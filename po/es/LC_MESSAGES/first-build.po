msgid ""
"This tutorial provides a quick introduction to building Flatpaks. In it, "
"you will learn how to create a basic Flatpak application, which can be "
"installed and run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:8
msgid ""
"In order to complete this tutorial, you should have followed the `setup "
"guide on flatpak.org <http://flatpak.org/setup/>`_. You also need to have"
" installed ``flatpak-builder``, which is usually available from the same "
"repository as the ``flatpak`` package (e.g. use ``apt`` or ``dnf``). You "
"can also install it as a flatpak with ``flatpak install flathub "
"org.flatpak.Builder``."

msgid "1. Install a runtime and the matching SDK"
msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:17
msgid ""
"Flatpak requires every app to specify a runtime that it uses for its "
"basic dependencies. Each runtime has a matching SDK (Software Development"
" Kit), which contains all the things that are in the runtime, plus "
"headers and development tools. This SDK is required to build apps for the"
" runtime."

"In this tutorial we will use the Freedesktop 21.08 runtime and SDK. To "
"install these, run::"

"The app that is going to be created for this tutorial is a simple script."

msgid "3. Add a manifest"
msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:41
msgid ""
"Each Flatpak is built using a manifest file which provides basic "
"information about the application and instructions for how it is to be "
"built. To add a manifest to the hello world app, add the following to an "
"empty file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:61
msgid ""
"Now save the file alongside ``hello.sh`` and call it "
"``org.flatpak.Hello.yml``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:64
msgid ""
"In a more complex application, the manifest would list multiple modules. "
"The last one would typically be the application itself, and the earlier "
"ones would be dependencies that are bundled with the app because they are"
" not part of the runtime."

"directory::"

"If you want to share the application you can put it in a repository. This"

msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:99
msgid ""
"This does the build again, and at the end exports the result to a local "
"directory called ``repo``. Note that ``flatpak-builder`` keeps a cache of"
" previous builds in the ``.flatpak-builder`` subdirectory, so doing a "
"second build like this is very fast."
msgstr ""

"In order for your application to show up in application stores while "
"testing with a local repository, you might have to run ``flatpak build-"

"Now we're ready to add the repository that was just created and install "
"the app. This is done with two commands::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first command adds the repository that was created in the previous "
"step. The second command installs the app from the repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:124
msgid ""
"Both these commands use the ``--user`` argument, which means that the "
"repository and the app are added per-user rather than system-wide. This "
"is useful for testing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../first-build.rst:128
msgid ""
"Note that the repository was added with ``--no-gpg-verify``, since a GPG "
"key wasn't specified when the app was built. This is fine for testing, "

"key."
