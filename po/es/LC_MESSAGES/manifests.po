"Exports are application files that are made available to the host, and "

#: ../../manifests.rst:48

"The names of files that are exported by a Flatpak must be prefixed using "
"the application ID, such as ``org.gnome.Dictionary.desktop``. The best "
"way to do this is to rename these files directly in the application's "
"source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manifests.rst:52
msgid ""
"If renaming exported files to use the application ID is not possible, "
"``flatpak-builder`` allows them to be renamed as part of the build "
"process. This can be done by specifying one of the following properties "
"in the manifest:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manifests.rst:57
msgid "``rename-icon`` - rename the application icon"

#: ../../manifests.rst:61
msgid ""
"Each of these properties accepts the name of the source file to be "
"renamed. ``flatpak-builder`` then automatically renames the file to match"
" the application ID. Note that this renaming method can introduce "
"internal naming conflicts, and that renaming files in tree is therefore "
"the most reliable approach."

#: ../../manifests.rst:70
msgid ""
"Applications that are run with Flatpak have extremely limited access to "

"the build stage where the application's sandbox permissions are "
"specified, in order to give access to these resources."

"The module list specifies each of the modules that are to be built as "
