"The names of files that are exported by a Flatpak must be prefixed using "
"the application ID, such as ``org.gnome.Dictionary.desktop``. The best "
"way to do this is to rename these files directly in the application's "
"source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manifests.rst:52
msgid ""
"If renaming exported files to use the application ID is not possible, "
"``flatpak-builder`` allows them to be renamed as part of the build "
"process. This can be done by specifying one of the following properties "
"in the manifest:"

#: ../../manifests.rst:57

"Each of these properties accepts the name of the source file to be "
"renamed. ``flatpak-builder`` then automatically renames the file to match"
" the application ID. Note that this renaming method can introduce "
"internal naming conflicts, and that renaming files in tree is therefore "
"the most reliable approach."

"Applications that are run with Flatpak have extremely limited access to "
