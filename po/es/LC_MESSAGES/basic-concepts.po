"Flatpak can be understood through a small number of key concepts. It is "
"useful to be familiar with these before learning about how to use Flatpak "
"from the command line, or using it to build applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:9
msgid "Runtimes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:11
msgid ""
"Runtimes provide the basic dependencies that are used by applications. Each "
"application must be built against a runtime, and this runtime must be "
"installed on a host system in order for the application to run (Flatpak can "
"automatically install the runtime required by an application). Multiple "
"different runtimes can be installed at the same time, including different "
"versions of the same runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:13
msgid ""
"Runtimes are distribution agnostic and do not depend on particular "
"distribution versions. This means that they provide a stable, cross-"
"distribution base for applications, and allow applications to continue to "
"work irrespective of operating system updates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:16
msgid "Bundled libraries"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:18
msgid ""
"If an application requires any dependencies that aren't in its runtime, they"
" can be bundled as part of the application. This gives application "
"developers flexibility regarding the dependencies that they use, including "
"using:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sandboxes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:27
msgid ""
"With Flatpak, each application is built and run in an isolated environment, "
"which is called the 'sandbox'. Each sandbox contains an application and its "
"runtime. By default, the application can only access the contents of its "
"sandbox. Access to user files, network, graphics sockets, subsystems on the "
"bus and devices have to be explicitly granted. Access to other things, such "
"as other processes, is deliberately not possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:29
msgid ""
"By necessity, some resources that are inside the sandbox need to be exposed "
"outside, to be used by the host system. These are known as 'exports', since "
"they are files that are exported out of the sandbox, and include things like"
" the application's ``.desktop`` file and icon."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:32
msgid "Portals"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:34
msgid ""
"Portals are a mechanism through which applications can interact with the "
"host environment from within a sandbox. They give the ability to interact "
"with data, files and services without the need to add sandbox permissions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:36
msgid ""
"Examples of capabilities that can be accessed through portals include "
"opening files through a file chooser dialog, or printing. Interface toolkits"
" can implement transparent support for portals, so access to resources "
"outside of the sandbox will work securely and out of the box."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:38
msgid ""
"More information about portals can be found in :doc:`sandbox-permissions`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Repositories"
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:43
msgid ""
"Flatpak applications and runtimes are typically stored and published using "
"repositories, which behave very similarly to Git repositories. A Flatpak "
"repository can contain a single object or multiple objects, and each object "
"is versioned, which allows upgrading and even downgrading."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:45
msgid ""
"Each system which is using Flatpak can be configured to access any number of"
" remote repositories. Once a system has been configured to access a "
"'remote', the remote repository's content can be inspected and searched, and"
" it can be used as the source of applications and runtimes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basic-concepts.rst:47
msgid ""
"When an update is performed, new versions of installed applications and "
"runtimes are downloaded from the relevant remotes. Like with Git, only the "
"difference between versions is downloaded, which makes the process very "
"efficient."
