"This page provides an overview of how Flatpak works internally. While it "
"isn't necessary to be familiar with this in order to use Flatpak, some "
"people might find it interesting. Knowing about Flatpak's architecture "
"also helps to get a better understanding of how and why it works the way "
"it does, from a user and application developer perspective."

"Flatpak is built on top of a technology called `OSTree "
"<https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/introduction/>`_, which is influenced"
" by and very similar to the Git version control system. Like Git, OSTree "
"allows versioned data to be tracked and to be distributed between "
"different repositories. However, where Git is designed to track source "
"files, OSTree is designed to track binary files and other large data."

#: ../../under-the-hood.rst:20
msgid ""
"Internally, Flatpak therefore works in a similar way to Git, and many "
"Flatpak concepts are analogous to Git concepts. Like Git, Flatpak uses "
"repositories to store data, and it tracks the differences between "
"versions."

"With Flatpak, each application, runtime and extension is a branch in a "
"repository. An identifier triple, such as "
"``com.company.App/x86_64/stable`` is a reference to that branch. The "
"output of a Flatpak build process is a directory of files which is "
"committed to one of these branches."

#: ../../under-the-hood.rst:29
msgid ""
"When an application is installed with Flatpak, it is pulled from the "
"remote into a new branch in a local repository. Links are then generated "
"which point from the right places in the filesystem to the application's "
"files in the repository (these are `hard links "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link>`_, which are fast to resolve "
"and disk space efficient). In other words, every application that is "
"installed is stored in a local version control repository, and is then "
"mapped into the local filesystem."

"Version tracking is therefore a core part of Flatpak's architecture, and "
"this makes updating software to the latest version very efficient. "
"Versioning also makes rollbacks possible, so it's easy to go back to a "
"previous version, should that be required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Storing applications in a local OSTree repository has other advantages. "
"For example, it allows files that are stored on disk to be deduplicated, "
"so the same file that belongs to multiple applications (or runtimes) is "
"only stored once."
