"Flatpak deliberately makes as few requirements of applications as "
"possible. However, a small number of standard Linux desktop conventions "
"are expected, primarily to ensure that applications integrate with Linux "
"desktops and app centers. Developers might also encounter a small number "
"of Linux technical conventions."

msgid ""
"Applications that use Flatpak are generally expected to comply with the "
"following standards. Applications that have previously targeted the Linux"
" desktop will typically need to make very few (if any) changes to do "
"this."

msgid "Application IDs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../conventions.rst:23
msgid ""
"As described in :doc:`using-flatpak`, Flatpak requires each application "
"to have a unique identifier, which has a form such as "
"``org.gnome.Dictionary``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../conventions.rst:26
msgid ""
"The format is in reverse-DNS style so the first section should be a "
"domain controlled by the project and the trailing section represents the "
"specific project. There are some exceptions to this, such as extensions "
"using the base application-id of the project they extend rather than "
"their own."
msgstr ""

#: ../../conventions.rst:31
msgid ""
"As will be seen below and in future sections, this ID is expected to be "
"used in a number of places. Developers must follow the standard `D-Bus "
"naming conventions for bus names <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-"
"specification.html#message-protocol-names>`_ when creating their own IDs."
" This format is already recommended by the `Desktop File specification "

#: ../../conventions.rst:45
msgid ""
"This is a bad ID because the Appstream standard for legacy reasons treats"
" IDs ending with ``.desktop`` as a special case causing inconsistency. "
"For this same reason, ``.Desktop`` suffixes should not be used for newly "
"named applications. Don't hesitate to repeat the application name even if"

"This is problematic because while ``foo.github.io`` may be unique to your"

"cause issues if another project creates ``io.github.Foo-Bar`` which "
"should be its own namespace but areas of ``flatpak`` may treat them "
