"Flatpak repositories use archive-z2, meaning that they contain a single "
"file for each file in the application. This means that pull operations "
"involve a lot of HTTP requests. Since new requests can be slow, it is "

"your repository."

"Flatpak supports something called static deltas. These are single files "
"that contain all the data needed to go between two revisions (or from "
