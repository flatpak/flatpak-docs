" fstab etc. and each of them can have different defaults. Flatpak has no "
"control over how and where they get mounted. The following filesystem "
"permissions should work in most cases::"

"Giving network access also grants access to all host services listening "
"on abstract Unix sockets (due to how network namespaces work), and these "
"have no permission checks. This unfortunately affects e.g. the X server "
"and the session bus which listens to abstract sockets by default. A "
"secure distribution should disable these and just use regular sockets."

"``xdg-{cache, config, data}`` bind mounts the paths from host to the per-"

"``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` and ``$XDG_DATA_HOME`` is set to "
"``$HOME/.var/app/$FLATPAK_ID/{cache, config, data}`` respectively. So for"

"on host is bind mounted to "
"``$HOME/.var/app/$FLATPAK_ID/data/applications`` (inside the sandbox this"
