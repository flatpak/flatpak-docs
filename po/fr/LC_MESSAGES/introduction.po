"Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications across "
"various Linux distributions. It has been created by developers who have a"
" long history of working on the Linux desktop, and is run as an "
"independent open source project."

msgid ""
"Flatpak: a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed "
"desktop applications on Linux."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:12
msgid ""
"Flatpak application: these are the applications the user installs via the"
" ``flatpak`` command or via a different UI like GNOME Software or KDE "
"Discover."
msgstr ""

"Runtime: also called platforms, these are integrated platforms to provide"
" basic utilities needed for a Flatpak application to work."

msgid "Target audience"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:22
msgid ""
"Flatpak can be used by all kinds of desktop applications, and aims to be "
"as agnostic as possible regarding how applications are built. There are "
"no requirements regarding which programming languages, build tools, "
"toolkits or frameworks can be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:27
msgid ""
"While Flatpak only runs on Linux, it can be used by applications that "
"target other operating systems, as well as those that are Linux-specific."
" Applications can be open source or proprietary (although some "
"distribution services, like `Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, can have "
"restrictions in this respect)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:32
msgid ""
"The only technical requirements made by Flatpak are that applications "
"follow a small number of Freedesktop standards, in order to enable "
"desktop integration (see :doc:`conventions`)."

msgid "Issues of current model of packaging"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:39
msgid ""
"It is important to understand the problems of the current model of "
"packaging applications to understand the existence of Flatpak:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:42
msgid ""
"**Duplicated work packaging apps**: many Linux distributions come with "
"their own package manager, package format and repository. This requires a"
" lot of maintainers to package the same application in various "
"distributions, or the application developer to learn the language of each"
" format and then package the application in those distributions, or "
"ignore most distributions and package and support a couple of "
"distributions. This makes the Linux desktop a difficult platform for "
"software vendors to target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:48
msgid ""
"**Limited to apps that are packaged**: not all applications are natively "
"available in every Linux distribution. If an application is not available"
" in a specific distribution, the user will have to rely on manually "
"downloading the archive of the application, extracting it and hoping the "
"application will launch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:52
msgid ""
"**Limited to distributions that have the apps**: the user is limited to "
"the number of distributions that have the needed applications for them to"
" properly setup their workflow. This reduces the amount of distributions "
"that can be suitable for a user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:56
msgid ""
"**Hard to innovate in OS space**: the maintainers of the distributions "
"have to spend a lot of time packaging applications to make the "
"distribution suitable for the end user, instead of focusing on their end "
"goals. This delays the progress of each distribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:59
msgid ""
"**Old and outdated packages**: LTS distributions often have very old "
"versions of applications packaged natively. Bug reproducibility is "
"hindered by the different environments that applications are run in, and "
"application developers often have little control over how their "
"application is packaged by distributions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:64
msgid ""
"Flatpak strives to fix the issues listed above, by conveniently enabling "
"developers to distribute applications from one source and to target the "
"entire Linux desktop."

msgid "Reasons to use Flatpak"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:70
msgid "Flatpak has some major advantages over most system package managers:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:72
msgid ""
"**Universality**: Flatpak allows applications to be installed and run on "
"virtually any Linux distribution. This includes non-GNU distributions, "
"systemd-free distributions, distributions with a read-only operating "
"system (OS), and various architectures without the developer needing the "
"relevant hardware on hand."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:76
msgid ""
"**Space for innovations**: Flatpak facilitates distribution maintainers "
"to focus on their goals to innovate their distribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:78
msgid ""
"**Stability**: breakage in a Flatpak application will not risk the system"
" from breaking. This is because Flatpak applications and runtimes are "
"contained to not interfere with the system altogether."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:81
msgid ""
"**Rootless install**: elevated privileges are not required when "
"installing a Flatpak application or a runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:83
msgid ""
"**Sandboxed applications**: one of Flatpak's main goals is to increase "
"the security of desktop systems by isolating applications from one "
"another. This is achieved using sandboxing and means that, by default, "
"applications that are run with Flatpak have limited access to the host "
"environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:87
msgid ""
"Flatpak has some major advantages over other universal approaches to "
"distributing applications on Linux:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:90
msgid ""
"**Decentralized by design**: while Flatpak does provide a centralized "
"service for distributing applications, it also allows decentralized "
"hosting and distribution, so that application developers or downstreams "
"can host their own applications and application repositories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:94
msgid ""
"**Desktop integration**: Flatpak also offers native integration for the "
"main Linux desktops, so that users can easily browse, install, run and "
"use Flatpak applications through their existing desktop environment and "
"tools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:97
msgid ""
"**Space efficiency**: Flatpak deduplicates libraries and other files used"
" by multiple applications to save megabytes or even gigabytes worth of "
"storage depending on the amount of applications installed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:100
msgid "**Delta updates**: only changed files are downloaded for updates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:102
msgid "Other benefits for developers include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:104
msgid ""
"**Forward-compatibility**: the same Flatpak application can be run on "
"different versions of the same distribution, including versions that "
"haven't been released yet. This doesn't require any changes or management"
" by application developers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:107
msgid ""
"**Bundling**: this allows application developers to ship almost any "
"dependency or library as part of their application. This gives complete "
"control over which software is used to build applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:110
msgid ""
"**Consistent application environments**: because these are the same "
"across devices, applications perform as intended. This also makes it "
"easier to identify bugs and to do testing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:113
msgid ""
"**Branches**: this allows developers to ship applications from different "
"branches, e.g. ``stable``, ``beta``, etc. while retaining the same name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:115
msgid ""
"**Maintained platforms**: called runtimes, these contain collections of "
"dependencies, which can be used by applications, and which can take a lot"
" of the work out of application development."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:120
msgid ""
"In general Flatpak is best suited suited for desktop applications and "
"while command line applications also work, it may not be suited in some "
"cases:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:124
msgid ""
"Applications needs to elevate priviledges using ``su, sudo, pkexec`` etc."
" Flatpak cannot run in SUID binaries inside the sandbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:126
msgid ""
"Application needs to read ``/proc`` from host or have unfiltered access "
"to processes. This is not allowed as Flatpak has a private proc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:128
msgid ""
"Application uses a syscall that is blocklisted by Flatpak's seccomp "
"filter. For example, Flatpak won't allow spawning sub-namespaces in the "
"sandbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:131
msgid ""
"Kernel modules or drivers are non application packages and won't work "
"inside a Flatpak."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:134
msgid ""
"In general in cases where the sandbox prohibits the core functionality of"
" the application or makes it too inconvenient and/or obtrusive , it is "
"not best suited to be packaged with Flatpak."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:138
msgid ""
"Flatpak also won't export udev rules or systemd services from the sandbox"
" to the host and requires manual configuration after installing the "
"flatpak package."
msgstr ""
