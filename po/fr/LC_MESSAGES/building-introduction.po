"``flatpak-builder`` is the primary tool for building Flatpak "
"applications. It allows you to take the source files for an application "
"and build it into a Flatpak application. It also allows multiple other "
"dependencies to be built at the same time, which get bundled into the "
"build."

"It is packaged by several distributions and there is a `Flatpak package "
"<https://flathub.org/apps/org.flatpak.Builder>`_ called "
"``org.flatpak.Builder`` available for it too on Flathub."

"The input to ``flatpak-builder`` is a manifest file. This specifies the "
"parameters for the application that will be built, such as its name and "
"which runtime it will depend on. The manifest also lists all the modules "
"that are to be built as part of the build process. A source for each "
"module can be specified, including links to file archives or version "
"control repositories. One of the modules (usually the last one) is the "
"application code itself."

"Where ``<build-dir>`` is the path to the directory that the application "
"will be built into, and ``<manifest>`` is the path to a manifest file. "
"The contents of ``<build-dir>`` can be useful for testing and debugging "
"purposes, but is generally treated as an artifact of the build process."

"SDKs are like the regular runtime that applications run in. The "
