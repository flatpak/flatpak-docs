"Flatpak repositories are the primary mechanism for publishing applications, "
"so that they can be installed by users."

msgid ""
"Some aspects of repositories are addressed by other sections of the "
"documentation. Basic commands for adding, removing and inspecting "
"repositories can be found in the :doc:`using-flatpak` section. Additionally,"
" the section on :doc:`flatpak-builder` covers the most common method for "
"adding applications to repositories."

"To use a repository to publish an application, it is possible to either host"
" your own (covered in the next section, :doc:`hosting-a-repository`) or use "
"`Flathub <http://flathub.org>`_, the primary publishing and hosting service "
"for Flatpak applications."

msgid ""
"Software center applications like GNOME Software or KDE Discover allow "
"browsing repositories, and can also dynamically promote new or popular "
"applications. If you use Flathub, the repository will typically have already"
" been added by users, so adding an application to the repository is "
"sufficient to make it available to them."

"``.flatpakref`` files can be used in combination with repositories to "
"provide an additional, easy way for users to install an application, often "
"by clicking on the file or a download link."

"Internally, ``.flatpakref`` files are simple description files that include "
"information about a Flatpak application. An example::"

"As can be seen, the file includes the ID of the application and the location"
" of the repository that contains it, as well a link to information about the"
" repository that provides the application's runtime. ``.flatpakref`` files "
"therefore contain all the information needed to install an application."
msgstr ""

"``.flatpakref`` files should include the base64-encoded version of the GPG "

"One advantage of ``.flatpakref`` files is that they can be used to install "
"applications even if their repository hasn't been added by the user. In this"
" case the repository that contains the application will either be "
"automatically installed, or the user will be prompted to install it. This "
"will also happen if the necessary runtime isn't present."

msgid ""
"``.flatpakref`` can be used to install applications from the command line as"
" well as with graphical software installers. This is done with the standard "
"``flatpak install`` command, which accepts both local and remote "
"``.flatpakref`` files. For example::"

#: ../../repositories.rst:50
msgid ""
"Flatpak repositories are similar a Git repositories, in that they store "
"every version of an application by keeping a record of the difference "
"between each version. This makes updating efficient, since only the "
"difference (or \"delta\") between two versions needs to be downloaded when "
"an update is performed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../repositories.rst:52
msgid ""
"When a new version of an application is added to a repository, it "
"immediately becomes available to users. Software centers are able to "
"automatically check for and install new versions. Those who are using the "
"command line have to manually run ``flatpak update`` to check for and "
"install new versions of any applications they have installed."
