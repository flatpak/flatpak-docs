"Python applications that use supported build systems like Meson, CMake, "
"or Autotools can be built using the standard method. However, many Python"
" applications use custom install scripts or are expected to be installed "
"through Setuptools and ``pip``."

"For these cases, ``flatpak-builder`` provides the ``simple`` buildsystem."
" Rather than automating the build process, ``simple`` accepts a ``build-"
"commands`` array of strings, which are executed in sequence."

"Here, ``build-commands`` is an array containing the commands required to "
"build and install the module. As can be seen, in this case ``pip`` is run"
" to do this. Here, the ``--prefix=/app`` option is important, because "
"otherwise ``pip`` would try to install the module under ``/usr/`` which, "
"because ``/usr/`` is mounted read-only inside the sandbox, would fail."

"Note that ``--no-deps`` is only used for the purpose of the example - "
"since the requests module has its own dependencies, the build would fail."
" If multiple dependencies are required, it is better to install them "
"using the method in the next section, instead."

"For these cases, `flatpak-pip-generator <https://github.com/flatpak"
