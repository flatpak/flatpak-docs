"Flatpak provides a number of different options for how applications can "
"depend on other software. When setting out to build an application with "
"Flatpak for the first time, it is therefore necessary to decide how "
"application dependencies will be organized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:9
msgid ""
"This page outlines what the options are, and provides guidance on when to"
" use each one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Runtimes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:15
msgid ""
"As was described in :doc:`basic-concepts`, runtimes provide basic "
"dependencies that can be used by applications. They also provide the "
"environment that applications run in. Flatpak requires each application "
"to specify a runtime. Therefore, one of the first decisions you need to "
"make when building an application with Flatpak, is which runtime it will "
"use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:21
msgid ""
"An overview of the runtimes that are available can be found in the :doc"
":`available-runtimes` page. There are deliberately only a small number of"
" runtimes to choose from. Typically, runtimes are picked on the basis of "
"which dependencies an application requires. If a runtime exists that "
"provides libraries that you plan on using, this is usually the correct "
"runtime to use!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:29
msgid ""
"Runtimes require regular maintenance, and application developers should "
"generally not consider creating their own."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:32
msgid ""
"Runtimes are automatically installed for users when they install an "
"application, and build tools can also automatically install them for you "
"(``flatpak-builder``'s ``--install-deps-from`` option is useful for "
"this). However, if you do need to manually install your chosen runtime, "
"this can be done in the same way as installing an application, with the "
"``flatpak install`` command. For example, the command to install the "
"GNOME 43 runtime is::"

msgid "Bundling"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:45
msgid ""
"One of the key advantages of Flatpak is that it allows application "
"authors to bundle whatever libraries or dependencies that they want. This"
" means that developers aren't constrained by which libraries are "
"available through Linux distributions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:50
msgid ""
"When it comes to building an application for the first time, you will "
"need to decide which dependencies to bundle. This can include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:53
msgid "libraries that aren't in your chosen runtime"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:54
msgid "different versions of libraries that are in your chosen runtime"

msgid "data or other resources that form part of the application"

msgid ""
"As will be seen, bundled dependencies can be automatically downloaded as "
"part of the build process. It is also possible to apply patches and "
"perform other transformations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:62
msgid ""
"While bundling is very powerful and flexible, it also places a greater "
"maintenance burden on the application developer. Therefore, while it is "
"possible to bundle as much as you would like, it is generally recommended"
" to try and keep the number of bundled modules as low as possible. If a "
"dependency is available as part of a runtime, it is generally better to "
"use that version rather than bundle it yourself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:69

"The specifics of how to bundle libraries is covered in the "
":doc:`manifests` section."

#: ../../dependencies.rst:73
msgid "Base apps"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:75
msgid ""
"Runtimes and bundling are the two main ways in which dependencies are "
"handled with Flatpak. They allow applications to rely on stable "
"collections of dependencies on the one hand, and to have flexibility and "
"control on the other."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:79
msgid ""
"However, in some cases, dependencies come as part of a bigger framework "
"or toolkit, which doesn't fit into a runtime but which is also cumbersome"
" to manually bundle as a series of individual modules. This is where "
"*base apps* come in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:84
msgid ""
"Base apps contain collections of bundled dependencies which can then be "
"bundled as part of an application. They don't get rebuilt as part of the "
"build process, which makes building faster (particularly when bundling "
"large dependencies). And because each base app is only built once, it is "
"guaranteed to be identical wherever it is used, so it will only be saved "
"once on disk."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:90
msgid ""
"Base apps are a relatively specialized concept and only some applications"
" need to use them (the most common base app is used for `Electron "
"applications <https://github.com/flathub/io.atom.electron.BaseApp>`_). "
"However, if your application uses a large, complex or specialized "
"framework, it is a good idea to check for available base apps before you "
"start building."

#: ../../dependencies.rst:97
msgid "Extensions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:99
msgid ""
"Runtimes and applications can define extension points which allow "
"optional additional runtimes to be mounted at a specified location inside"
" the sandbox when they are present on the system. Typical uses for "
"extensions include translations for applications, debuginfo for sdks, or "
"adding more functionality to the application. Some software refers to "
"these extensions as \"Add-ons\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:105
msgid ""
"For an extension to be loaded in the application or runtime, an extension"
" point first needs to be defined in the application or runtime in "
"question."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:109
msgid ""
"By convention, extension points follow the ID of the application or "
"runtime in question, followed by a generic term for the extension. For "
"example, the OBS Studio flatpak may define an extension point "
"``com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin``, where \"Plugin\" is the generic term "
"prefixed by the application ID."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:115
msgid ""
"To see available extension points, it's best to look at the application "
"or runtime manifest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:118
msgid ""
"Any extension now choosing to be loaded inside the OBS Studio flatpak "
"must prefix their ID by ``com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin`` for example "
"``com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.Gstreamer``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some extension names having special significance are discussed below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:124
msgid ""
"``.Debug`` is used for Debug extensions by applications, runtimes and "
"SDKs. They are used for debugging purposes. Every application or runtime "
"built with ``flatpak-builder`` produces a ``.Debug`` extension unless "
"specifically disabled in the manifest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:129
msgid ""
"A ``.Debug`` extension will be needed when generating useful backtraces. "
"This is explained more in :doc:`debugging`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:132
msgid ""
"``.Locale`` is used for Locale extensions by applications or runtimes. "
"They add support for more languages to the parent application or runtime."
" These are usually partially downloaded by ``flatpak`` based on the "
"configured system locale. Every application or runtime built with "
"``flatpak-builder`` produces a ``.Locale`` extension unless specifically "
"disabled in the manifest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:139
msgid ""
"``.Sources`` is used for Sources extension by application or runtime. "
"They are used to bundle sources of the modules used in the application or"
" runtime in question. ``flatpak-builder`` will produce a ``.Sources`` "
"extension prefixed by ID when ``--bundle-sources`` is used."
