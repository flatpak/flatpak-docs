"Flatpak provides a number of different options for how applications can "
"depend on other software. When setting out to build an application with "
"Flatpak for the first time, it is therefore necessary to decide how "
"application dependencies will be organized."

" use each one."

msgid "Runtimes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:15
msgid ""
"As was described in :doc:`basic-concepts`, runtimes provide basic "
"dependencies that can be used by applications. They also provide the "
"environment that applications run in. Flatpak requires each application "
"to specify a runtime. Therefore, one of the first decisions you need to "
"make when building an application with Flatpak, is which runtime it will "
"use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:21
msgid ""
"An overview of the runtimes that are available can be found in the :doc"
":`available-runtimes` page. There are deliberately only a small number of"
" runtimes to choose from. Typically, runtimes are picked on the basis of "
"which dependencies an application requires. If a runtime exists that "
"provides libraries that you plan on using, this is usually the correct "
"runtime to use!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:29
msgid ""
"Runtimes require regular maintenance, and application developers should "
"generally not consider creating their own."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:32
msgid ""
"Runtimes are automatically installed for users when they install an "
"application, and build tools can also automatically install them for you "
"(``flatpak-builder``'s ``--install-deps-from`` option is useful for "
"this). However, if you do need to manually install your chosen runtime, "
"this can be done in the same way as installing an application, with the "
"``flatpak install`` command. For example, the command to install the "
"GNOME 3.26 runtime is::"

msgid "Bundling"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:45
msgid ""
"One of the key advantages of Flatpak is that it allows application "
"authors to bundle whatever libraries or dependencies that they want. This"
" means that developers aren't constrained by which libraries are "
"available through Linux distributions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When it comes to building an application for the first time, you will "
"need to decide which dependencies to bundle. This can include:"

"As will be seen, bundled dependencies can be automatically downloaded as "
"part of the build process. It is also possible to apply patches and "
"perform other transformations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:62
msgid ""
"While bundling is very powerful and flexible, it also places a greater "
"maintenance burden on the application developer. Therefore, while it is "
"possible to bundle as much as you would like, it is generally recommended"
" to try and keep the number of bundled modules as low as possible. If a "
"dependency is available as part of a runtime, it is generally better to "
"use that version rather than bundle it yourself."

":doc:`manifests` section."

#: ../../dependencies.rst:75
msgid ""
"Runtimes and bundling are the two main ways in which dependencies are "
"handled with Flatpak. They allow applications to rely on stable "
"collections of dependencies on the one hand, and to have flexibility and "
"control on the other."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:79
msgid ""
"However, in some cases, dependencies come as part of a bigger framework "
"or toolkit, which doesn't fit into a runtime but which is also cumbersome"
" to manually bundle as a series of individual modules. This is where "
"*base apps* come in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:84
msgid ""
"Base apps contain collections of bundled dependencies which can then be "
"bundled as part of an application. They don't get rebuilt as part of the "
"build process, which makes building faster (particularly when bundling "
"large dependencies). And because each base app is only built once, it is "
"guaranteed to be identical wherever it is used, so it will only be saved "
"once on disk."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dependencies.rst:90
msgid ""
"Base apps are a relatively specialized concept and only some applications"
" need to use them (the most common base app is used for `Electron "
"applications <https://github.com/flathub/io.atom.electron.BaseApp>`_). "
"However, if your application uses a large, complex or specialized "
"framework, it is a good idea to check for available base apps before you "
"start building."
