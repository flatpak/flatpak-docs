"As was described in :doc:`basic-concepts`, runtimes provide basic "

"如  :doc:`basic-"

"runtime to use!"

"While bundling is very powerful and flexible, it also places a greater "

"虽然捆绑非常强大和灵活，但它也给应用程序开发人员带来了更大的维护负担。因此，尽管可以尽可能多地进行打包，但通常建议尽量减少打包模块的数量。如果依赖项作为运行时的一部分并是可用的，通常最好使用该版本，而不是自己打包。"

"Base apps contain collections of bundled dependencies which can then be "

"base "
"apps包含了一个捆绑好的依赖的集合，这些依赖可以作为应用的一部分被捆绑。他们不会在构建过程中被重建，可以使得构建更快（特别是在构建大型的依赖时）。由于每个base"
