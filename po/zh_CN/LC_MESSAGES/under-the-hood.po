"This page provides an overview of how Flatpak works internally. While it "
"isn't necessary to be familiar with this in order to use Flatpak, some "
"people might find it interesting. Knowing about Flatpak's architecture "
"also helps to get a better understanding of how and why it works the way "
"it does, from a user and application developer perspective."

"Flatpak is built on top of a technology called `OSTree "
"<https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/introduction/>`_, which is influenced"
" by and very similar to the Git version control system. Like Git, OSTree "
"allows versioned data to be tracked and to be distributed between "
"different repositories. However, where Git is designed to track source "
"files, OSTree is designed to track binary files and other large data."
msgstr ""
"Flatpak建立在一种名为`OSTree "
"<https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/introduction/>`的技术之上，该技术受Git版本控制系统的影响，非常类似Git。与Git一样，OSTree允许跟踪版本化数据并在不同的仓库间分发。不同的是，Git为跟踪源文件设计，OSTree为跟踪二进制文件和其他大数据设计。"

"With Flatpak, each application, runtime and extension is a branch in a "
"repository. An identifier triple, such as "
"``com.company.App/x86_64/stable`` is a reference to that branch. The "
"output of a Flatpak build process is a directory of files which is "
"committed to one of these branches."
msgstr ""
"使用Flatpak，每个应用程序，运行时和扩展都是仓库中的一个分支。 标识符三元组，例如 `` "

"When an application is installed with Flatpak, it is pulled from the "
"remote into a new branch in a local repository. Links are then generated "
"which point from the right places in the filesystem to the application's "
"files in the repository (these are `hard links "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link>`_, which are fast to resolve "
"and disk space efficient). In other words, every application that is "
"installed is stored in a local version control repository, and is then "
"mapped into the local filesystem."
msgstr ""
"使用Flatpak安装应用时，会将其从远程仓库中拉入到本地仓库中的新分支。 "
"然后生成从文件系统指向仓库的链接（这些链接是快速解析和高效利用的磁盘空间`硬链接 "

"Version tracking is therefore a core part of Flatpak's architecture, and "
"this makes updating software to the latest version very efficient. "
"Versioning also makes rollbacks possible, so it's easy to go back to a "
"previous version, should that be required."

"Storing applications in a local OSTree repository has other advantages. "
"For example, it allows files that are stored on disk to be deduplicated, "
"so the same file that belongs to multiple applications (or runtimes) is "
"only stored once."
msgstr "将应用程序存储在本地OSTree存储库中具有其他优点。 例如，它允许对存储在磁盘上的文件去重，所以属于多个应用程序（或运行时）的同一文件仅存储一次。"
