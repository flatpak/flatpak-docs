"This page provides an overview of how Flatpak works internally. While it "
"isn't necessary to be familiar with this in order to use Flatpak, some "
"people might find it interesting. Knowing about Flatpak's architecture also "
"helps to get a better understanding of how and why it works the way it does, "
"from a user and application developer perspective."
msgstr ""
"本页面简单介绍了Flatpak内部工作原理。虽然仅仅是使用Flatpak没必要熟悉这些，但是有些人可会会觉得这很有趣。从用户和应用开发者的角度来看，了解Flatpak的体系结构还有助于更好地理解它的工作方式和原因。"

"Flatpak is built on top of a technology called `OSTree <https://ostree."
"readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/introduction/>`_, which is influenced by and "
"very similar to the Git version control system. Like Git, OSTree allows "
"versioned data to be tracked and to be distributed between different "
"repositories. However, where Git is designed to track source files, OSTree "
"is designed to track binary files and other large data."

"Flatpak建立在一种名为`OSTree <https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/"
"introduction/"
">`的技术之上，该技术受Git版本控制系统的影响，非常类似Git。与Git一样，OSTree允许跟踪版本化数据并在不同的仓库间分发。不同的是，Git为跟踪源文件设计，OSTree为跟踪二进制文件和其他大数据设计。"

"Internally, Flatpak therefore works in a similar way to Git, and many "
"Flatpak concepts are analagous to Git concepts. Like Git, Flatpak uses "
"repositories to store data, and it tracks the differences between versions."
msgstr ""
"在内部，Flatpak的工作方式与Git类似，许多Flatpak概念与Git概念类似。 "
"与Git一样，Flatpak使用仓库来存储数据，并跟踪版本之间的差异。"

"With Flatpak, each application, runtime and extension is a branch in a "
"repository. An identifier triple, such as ``com.company.App/i386/stable`` is "
"a reference to that branch. The output of a Flatpak build process is a "
"directory of files which is committed to one of these branches."
msgstr ""
"使用Flatpak，每个应用程序，运行时和扩展都是仓库中的一个分支。 标识符三元组，例如``com.company.App/i386/"
"stable``是对该分支的引用。 Flatpak构建过程的输出是一个文件目录，它提交给其中一个分支。"

"When an application is installed with Flatpak, it is pulled from the remote "
"into a new branch in a local repository. Links are then generated which "
"point from the right places in the filesystem to the application's files in "
"the repository (these are `hard links <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Hard_link>`_, which are fast to resolve and disk space efficient). In other "
"words, every application that is installed is stored in a local version "
"control repository, and is then mapped into the local filesystem."
msgstr ""
"使用Flatpak安装应用时，会将其从远程仓库中拉入到本地仓库中的新分支。 "
"然后生成从文件系统指向仓库的链接（这些链接是快速解析和高效利用的磁盘空间`硬链接 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Hard_link>`）。 换句话说，安装的每个应用程序都存储在本地版本控制仓库中，然后映射到本地文件系统。"

"Version tracking is therefore a core part of Flatpak's architecture, and "
"this makes updating software to the latest version very efficient. "
"Versioning also makes rollbacks possible, so it's easy to go back to a "
"previous version, should that be required."
msgstr ""
"因此，版本跟踪是Flatpak架构的核心部分，这使得更新软件非常高效。 版本控制也使回滚成为可能，因此如果需要，可以很容易地回滚到以前的版本。"

"Storing applications in a local OSTree repository has other advantages. For "
"example, it allows files that are stored on disk to be deduplicated, so the "
"same file that belongs to multiple applications (or runtimes) is only stored "
"once."
msgstr ""
"将应用程序存储在本地OSTree存储库中具有其他优点。 例如，它允许对存储在磁盘上的文件去重，所以属于多个应用程序（或运行时）的同一文件仅存储一次。"
