"Each Flatpak app is required to have a runtime. This provides the "
"environment that the app runs in, and includes a set of libraries that it "
"can access. The app's runtime must be present on a system for it to run."

"Each runtime is paired with an SDK (Software Develpment Kit). For example, "
"for the Freedesktop 1.6 runtime, there is also a Freedesktop 1.6 SDK. The "
"SDK includes the same things as the regular runtime, but also includes all "
"the additional development resources and tools that are required to build an "
"app, such as build and packaging tools, header files, compilers and "
"debuggers."

"每个runtime是和SDK配套的。举个例子，Freedesktop 1.6 runtime 对应 Freedesktop 1.6 "
