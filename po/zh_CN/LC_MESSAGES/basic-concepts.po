"Flatpak can be understood through a small number of key concepts. It is "
"useful to be familiar with these before learning about how to use Flatpak"

"Runtimes provide the basic dependencies that are used by applications. "
"Each application must be built against a runtime, and this runtime must "
"be installed on a host system in order for the application to run "
"(Flatpak can automatically install the runtime required by an "
"application). Multiple different runtimes can be installed at the same "
"time, including different versions of the same runtime."
msgstr "运行时提供应用程序使用的基本依赖项。每个应用程序都必须针对运行时构建，并且这个运行时必须安装在主机系统上，以便应用程序运行(Flatpak可以自动安装应用程序所需的运行时)。可以同时安装多个不同的运行时以及同一运行时的不同版本。"

msgid ""
"Runtimes are distribution agnostic and do not depend on particular "
"distribution versions. This means that they provide a stable, cross-"
"distribution base for applications, and allow applications to continue to"
" work irrespective of operating system updates."
msgstr "运行时是发行版无关的，而且不依赖发行版的特定版本。这意味着他们为应用程序提供了一个稳定、跨发行版的基础，这使得应用程序可以不管操作系统的升级"

msgid ""
"With Flatpak, each application is built and run in an isolated "
"environment, which is called the 'sandbox'. Each sandbox contains an "
"application and its runtime. By default, the application can only access "
"the contents of its sandbox. Access to user files, network, graphics "
"sockets, subsystems on the bus and devices have to be explicitly granted."
" Access to other things, such as other processes, is deliberately not "
"possible."
msgstr "使用Flatpak，每个应用程序都构建和运行在被称为“沙箱”的独立环境。每个沙箱包含一个应用和它的运行时。默认的，这个应用只能访问沙箱里面的内容。要访问用户文件、网络、图形套接字、总线上的子系统和设备必须被显式地授权。访问其它的东西，比如其它进程，是故意被设计成不可能的"

"By necessity, some resources that are inside the sandbox need to be "

"Portals are a mechanism through which applications can interact with the "

"Examples of capabilities that can be accessed through portals include "
"opening files through a file chooser dialog, or printing. Interface "
"toolkits can implement transparent support for portals, so access to "

"Flatpak applications and runtimes are typically stored and published "

msgstr "Flatpak应用和运行时通常使用仓库存储和发布，这个仓库和git仓库类似。一个Flatpak仓库可以包含单个或者多个对象，而且每个对象都是版本化的，可以升级和降级。"

"Each system which is using Flatpak can be configured to access any number"

"When an update is performed, new versions of installed applications and "
