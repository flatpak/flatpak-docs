"Flatpak can be understood through a small number of key concepts. It is "
"useful to be familiar with these before learning about how to use Flatpak "
"from the command line, or using it to build applications."

"Runtimes provide the basic dependencies that are used by applications. Each "
"application must be built against a runtime, and this runtime must be "
"installed on a host system in order for the application to run (Flatpak can "
"automatically install the runtime required by an application). Multiple "
"different runtimes can be installed at the same time, including different "
"versions of the same runtime."

"运行时提供应用程序使用的基本依赖项。每个应用程序都必须针对运行时构建，并且这个运行时必须安装在主机系统上，以便应用程序运行(Flatpak可以自动安装应用程序所需的运行时)。可以同时安装多个不同的运行时以及同一运行时的不同版本。"

"Runtimes are distribution agnostic and do not depend on particular "
"distribution versions. This means that they provide a stable, cross-"
"distribution base for applications, and allow applications to continue to "
"work irrespective of operating system updates."
msgstr ""
"运行时是发行版无关的，而且不依赖发行版的特定版本。这意味着他们为应用程序提供了一个稳定、跨发行版的基础，这使得应用程序可以不管操作系统的升级"

msgstr "捆绑库"

"If an application requires any dependencies that aren't in its runtime, they "

msgid ""
"With Flatpak, each application is built and run in an isolated environment, "
"which is called the 'sandbox'. Each sandbox contains an application and its "
"runtime. By default, the application can only access the contents of its "
"sandbox. Access to user files, network, graphics sockets, subsystems on the "
"bus and devices have to be explicitly granted. Access to other things, such "
"as other processes, is deliberately not possible."
msgstr ""
"使用Flatpak，每个应用程序都构建和运行在被称为“沙箱”的独立环境。每个沙箱包含一个应用和它的运行时。默认的，这个应用只能访问沙箱里面的内容。要访问用户文件、网络、图形套接字、总线上的子系统和设备必须被显式地授权。访问其它的东西，比如其它进程，是故意被设计成不可能的"

"By necessity, some resources that are inside the sandbox need to be exposed "
"outside, to be used by the host system. These are known as 'exports', since "
"they are files that are exported out of the sandbox, and include things like "
"the application's ``.desktop`` file and icon."

"Portals are a mechanism through which applications can interact with the "

"Examples of capabilities that can be accessed through portals include "
"opening files through a file chooser dialog, or printing. Interface toolkits "

msgid ""
"Flatpak applications and runtimes are typically stored and published using "

"repository can contain a single object or multiple objects, and each object "

msgstr ""
"Flatpak应用和运行时通常使用仓库存储和发布，这个仓库和git仓库类似。一个Flatpak仓库可以包含单个或者多个对象，而且每个对象都是版本化的，可以升级和降级。"

"Each system which is using Flatpak can be configured to access any number of "
"remote repositories. Once a system has been configured to access a 'remote', "
"the remote repository's content can be inspected and searched, and it can be "

msgstr ""
"每个使用Flatpak的系统都可以配置多个远程仓库。一旦一个系统被配置成可以访问某个远程仓库，这个远程仓库的内容就可以被检测和搜索，它也可以被用作应用和运行时的源"

"When an update is performed, new versions of installed applications and "
