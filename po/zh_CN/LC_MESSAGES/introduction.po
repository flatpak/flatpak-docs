msgid ""
"**Fragmentation and duplicated work**: each Linux distribution has their "

"distributions. Furthermore, developers either need to learn the format of"
" every distribution or support only a few. This makes the Linux desktop a"
" difficult platform for software vendors to target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:49
msgid ""
"**Limited to apps that are packaged**: not every application is packaged "

"**Rootless install**: Flatpak does not require elevated privileges to "
"install applications or runtimes."
