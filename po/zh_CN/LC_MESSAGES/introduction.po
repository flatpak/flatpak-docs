"various Linux distributions. It has been created by developers who have a"
" long history of working on the Linux desktop, and is run as an "
"independent open source project."

msgid ""
"It is important to understand the problems of the current model of "

msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:42
msgid ""
"**Duplicated work packaging apps**: many Linux distributions come with "
"their own package manager, package format and repository. This requires a"
" lot of maintainers to package the same application in various "
"distributions, or the application developer to learn the language of each"
" format and then package the application in those distributions, or "
"ignore most distributions and package and support a couple of "
"distributions. This makes the Linux desktop a difficult platform for "
"software vendors to target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:48
msgid ""
"**Limited to apps that are packaged**: not all applications are natively "
"available in every Linux distribution. If an application is not available"
" in a specific distribution, the user will have to rely on manually "
"downloading the archive of the application, extracting it and hoping the "
"application will launch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:52
msgid ""
"**Limited to distributions that have the apps**: the user is limited to "
"the number of distributions that have the needed applications for them to"
" properly setup their workflow. This reduces the amount of distributions "
"that can be suitable for a user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:56
msgid ""
"**Hard to innovate in OS space**: the maintainers of the distributions "
"have to spend a lot of time packaging applications to make the "
"distribution suitable for the end user, instead of focusing on their end "
"goals. This delays the progress of each distribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:59
msgid ""
"**Old and outdated packages**: LTS distributions often have very old "
"versions of applications packaged natively. Bug reproducibility is "
"hindered by the different environments that applications are run in, and "
"application developers often have little control over how their "
"application is packaged by distributions."

msgid "Flatpak has some major advantages over most system package managers:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:72
msgid ""
"**Universality**: Flatpak allows applications to be installed and run on "
"virtually any Linux distribution. This includes non-GNU distributions, "
"systemd-free distributions, distributions with a read-only operating "
"system (OS), and various architectures without the developer needing the "
"relevant hardware on hand."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:76
msgid ""
"**Space for innovations**: Flatpak facilitates distribution maintainers "
"to focus on their goals to innovate their distribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:78
msgid ""
"**Stability**: breakage in a Flatpak application will not risk the system"
" from breaking. This is because Flatpak applications and runtimes are "
"contained to not interfere with the system altogether."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:81
msgid ""
"**Rootless install**: elevated privileges are not required when "
"installing a Flatpak application or a runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:83
msgid ""
"**Sandboxed applications**: one of Flatpak's main goals is to increase "
"the security of desktop systems by isolating applications from one "
"another. This is achieved using sandboxing and means that, by default, "
"applications that are run with Flatpak have limited access to the host "
"environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:87
msgid ""
"Flatpak has some major advantages over other universal approaches to "
"distributing applications on Linux:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:90
#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"**Decentralized by design**: while Flatpak does provide a centralized "
"service for distributing applications, it also allows decentralized "
"hosting and distribution, so that application developers or downstreams "
"can host their own applications and application repositories."
msgstr "最后，虽然Flatpak确实为分发应用程序提供了中心化服务，但它还允许分布式托管和分发，以便应用开发者或下游可以托管他们自己的应用和应用仓库。"

"**Desktop integration**: Flatpak also offers native integration for the "
"main Linux desktops, so that users can easily browse, install, run and "
