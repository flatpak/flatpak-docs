"Flatpak requires each application to specify a runtime, and this runtime "

"An overview of the runtimes that are available can be found in the :doc:"

"runtime to use!"

"一个可用runtime的概览可以在:doc:`available-"

msgid ""
"One of the key advantages of Flatpak is that it allows application authors "
"to bundle whatever libraries or dependencies that they want. This means that "
"developers aren't constrained by which libraries are available through Linux "
"distributions. It also provides flexibility, allowing particular versions of "
"libraries to be used, or the use of libraries that have been patched."
msgstr ""
"flatpak的一个关键优点是允许应用作者绑定任何他们想要的库或依赖。这意味着开发者无需考虑某个库在某个Linux发行版上是否可用。它还提供了灵活性，允许使用库的特定版本，或者打过补丁的库。"

#: ../../building-basics.rst:39
msgid ""
"While bundling is very powerful and flexible, it also places a greater "
"maintenance burden on the application developer. Therefore, while it is "
"possible to bundle as much as you would like, it is generally recommended to "
"try and keep the number of bundled modules as low as possible. If a "
"dependency is available as part of a runtime, it is generally better to use "
"the version from the runtime rather than bundle it yourself."
msgstr ""
"尽管绑定是非常强大和灵活的，它也给应用开发者带来了巨大的维护负担。因此，尽管可以绑定任意多的模块，还是建议尽量使用尽可能少的绑定。如果某个依赖在某个runtime可用，通常直接使用这个版本比自己绑定一个要好。"

"can be used by other applications, in order to share dependencies."

"flatpak允许任何模块，甚至是其他的应用，作为应用的一部分被绑定。通常，这用于为绑定而创建的特殊应用。这些应用被称作*base "

msgid ""
"Base apps don't get rebuilt as part of the build process, which makes "
"building faster (particularly when bundling large dependences). And because "
"each base app is only built once, it is guaranteed to be identical wherever "
"it is used, so it will only be saved once on disk."
msgstr ""
"base app在构建过程中不需要重新构建，使得构建更加快速（尤其是在绑定和依赖很多的时候）。因为每个base "
"app只构建一次，可以保证使用它的任何时候都是一致的，所以它只用在磁盘中保存一次。"

"A number of base apps are available and, unlike runtimes, they can be built "
