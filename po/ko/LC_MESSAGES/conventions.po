"Flatpak deliberately makes as few requirements of applications as "
"possible. However, a small number of standard Linux desktop conventions "
"are expected, primarily to ensure that applications integrate with Linux "
"desktops and app centers. Developers might also encounter a small number "
"of Linux technical conventions."

"Applications that use Flatpak are generally expected to comply with the "

"The format is in reverse-DNS style so the first section should be a "

"their own."

"This is a bad ID because the Appstream standard for legacy reasons treats"
