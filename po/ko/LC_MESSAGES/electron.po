"Base apps are described in :doc:`dependencies`.  Using the Electron base "

"The standard guidelines on sandbox permissions apply to Electron "

"To enable experimental `native Wayland` support in Electron>=20, the "

"It's important for Linux applications to set the correct desktop file "

"Wayland. By default Electron uses ``{appname}.desktop`` as desktop file "
"name. In Flatpak the name of the desktop file must be the id of the "
"Flatpak. To tell Electron to use another name you need to set the "

"\"com.example.MyApp.desktop\"``."

"By default, ``flatpak-builder`` doesn't allow build tools to access the "
"network. This means that tools which rely on downloading sources will not"

"means that these will be found when it comes to the build."

"Since even simple Node.js applications depend on dozens of packages, it "
"would be impractical to specify all of them as part of a manifest file. A"
" `Python script <https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-"
"tools/tree/master/node>`__ has therefore been developed to download "
"Node.js packages with NPM or Yarn and include them in an application's "

"The Python script requires a ``package-lock.json`` (or ``yarn.lock``) "

"application depends on, and can be generated by running ``npm install "
"--package-lock-only`` from an application's root directory. The script is"

"This generates the manifest JSON needed to build the NPM/Yarn packages "
"for the application, which are outputted to a file called ``generated-"
"sources.json``. The content of this file can be copied to the "
"application's manifest but, because it is often very long, it is often "

"Last but not least, since the simple build option is being used, a list "

"the ``npm_config_offline=true`` environment variable, installing "
"dependencies from packages that have already been cached. These are "

"Note that if the application you are trying to package contains a "
"``build`` block in ``package.json`` with instructions for Linux, this can"

#: ../../electron.rst:304
