"Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications across "

msgid ""
"Flatpak can be used by all kinds of desktop applications and aims to be "
"as agnostic as possible in terms of how applications are built. There are"
" no requirements regarding which programming languages, build tools, "
"toolkits or frameworks can be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:28
msgid ""
"While Flatpak only runs on Linux, it can be used by applications that "
"target other operating systems as well as those that are Linux-specific. "
"Applications can be open source or proprietary (although some "
"distribution services, like `Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, can have "
"restrictions in this respect)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:33
msgid ""
"Flatpak's only technical requirements are that applications follow a "

":doc:`conventions`)."

msgid "Issues with the current packaging model"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:40
msgid ""
"It is important to understand the problems with the current model of "
"packaging applications to understand the existence of Flatpak:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:43
msgid ""
"**Fragmentation and duplicated work**: each Linux distribution has their "
"own package managers and package formats that are incompatible with each "
"other. This leads to a lot of fragmentation and duplicated work since the"
" same application needs to be packaged multiple times for various "
"distributions. Furthermore, developers either need to learn the format of"
" every distribution or support only a few. This makes the Linux desktop a"
" difficult platform for software vendors to target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:49
msgid ""
"**Limited to apps that are packaged**: not every application is packaged "
"for every Linux distribution. If an application isn't packaged for a "
"specific distribution, users are left with limited and unreliable "
"options, often technical in nature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:52
msgid ""
"**Limited to distributions that have the apps**: users are limited to "
"only the distributions that have all the necessary applications for their"
" workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:54
msgid ""
"**Hard to innovate in OS space**: distribution maintainers spend a huge "
"amount of time and effort in packaging rather than focusing on improving "
"their distributions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:56
msgid ""
"**Old and outdated packages**: LTS distributions often have very old "
"versions of applications packaged. This complicates bug reproducibility "
"or leads to support requests for bugs that have been fixed upstream in "
"newer versions."

msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:66
msgid "Flatpak offers major advantages over most system package managers:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:68
msgid ""
"**Universality**: Flatpak allows applications to be installed and run on "
"virtually any Linux distribution, including non-GNU distributions, "
"systemd-free distributions, immutable distributions and various "
"architectures without requiring the developer to have access to the "
"relevant hardware."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:72
msgid ""
"**Space for innovation**: Flatpak allows distribution maintainers to "
"focus on innovating their distribution without being burdened by "
"packaging concerns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:74
msgid ""
"**Stability**: breakages in Flatpak applications do not affect the system"
" since they run in isolated environments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:76
msgid ""
"**Rootless install**: Flatpak does not require elevated privileges to "
"install applications or runtimes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:78
msgid ""
"**Sandboxed applications**: one of Flatpak's main goals is to increase "
"the security of desktop systems. This is achieved by isolating "
"applications from one another and limiting their access to the host "
"environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:82
msgid ""
"Flatpak also offers advantages over other universal approaches to Linux "
"application distribution:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:84
msgid ""
"**Decentralized by design**: Flatpak offers decentralized hosting and "
"distribution, allowing developers or downstreams to host their own "
"applications and application repositories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:87
msgid ""
"**Desktop integration**: Flatpak offers native integration with many "
"Linux desktop environments, allowing users to easily browse, install, "
"run, and manage Flatpak applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:89
msgid ""
"**Space efficiency**: Flatpak saves storage by deduplicating libraries "
"and other files used by multiple applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:91
msgid ""
"**Delta updates**: only updated data is downloaded during updates, saving"
" network bandwidth."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:93
msgid "Other benefits for developers include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:95
msgid ""
"**Forward-compatibility**: the same Flatpak application can run on "
"different versions of a distribution, including unreleased versions, "
"without needing any changes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:97
msgid ""
"**Bundling**: this allows application developers to ship almost any "
"dependency or library as part of their applications, giving them complete"
" control over their applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:100
msgid ""
"**Consistent application environments**: Flatpak provides a consistent "
"and identical application runtime environment across devices and "
"distributions. This makes bug identification and testing easier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:103
msgid ""
"**Branches**: this allows application developers to distribute multiple "
"branches of an application (e.g. ``stable``, ``beta``, etc.) while "
"retaining the same name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:105
msgid ""
"**Maintained platforms**: Flatpak runtimes contain a collection of common"
" dependencies for the applications to use, easing application development"
" and maintenance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:110
msgid ""
"In general, Flatpak is best suited for desktop applications. While "
"command-line applications also work, Flatpak may not be suitable in some "
"cases:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:114
msgid ""
"The application needs to elevate privileges using ``su``, ``sudo``, "
"``pkexec``, etc. Flatpak cannot run SUID binaries inside the sandbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:116
msgid ""
"The application requires access to ``/proc`` on the host or unfiltered "
"access to processes. This is not allowed as Flatpak has a private "
"``proc``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:118
msgid ""
"The application uses a syscall blocklisted by Flatpak's seccomp filter. "
"For example, Flatpak won't allow spawning sub-namespaces in the sandbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:121
msgid ""
"Kernel modules or drivers are non-application packages and won't work as "
"a Flatpak."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:124
msgid ""
"In general, if the sandbox prohibits an application's core functionality "
"or becomes too inconvenient or obtrusive, Flatpak may not be the most "
"suitable packaging choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:128
msgid ""
"Flatpak also won't export udev rules or systemd services from the sandbox"
