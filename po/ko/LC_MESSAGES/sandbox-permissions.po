"One of Flatpak's main goals is to increase the security of desktop "
"systems by isolating applications from one another. This is achieved "
"using sandboxing and means that, by default, applications that are run "
"with Flatpak have extremely limited access to the host environment. This "
"includes:"

"In many cases, portals use a system component to implicitly ask the user "
