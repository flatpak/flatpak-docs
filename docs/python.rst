Python
======

Python applications that use supported build systems like Meson, CMake,
or Autotools can be built using the standard method. However, many Python
applications use custom install scripts or are expected to be installed
through Setuptools and ``pip``.

For these cases, ``flatpak-builder`` provides the ``simple``
buildsystem. Rather than automating the build process, ``simple`` accepts a
``build-commands`` array of strings, which are executed in sequence.

For example, the following YAML makes building the popular requests module
rather straightforward:

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: requests
  buildsystem: simple
  build-commands:
    - pip3 install --prefix=/app --no-deps .
  sources:
    - type: archive
      url: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/r/requests/requests-2.18.4.tar.gz
      sha256: 9c443e7324ba5b85070c4a818ade28bfabedf16ea10206da1132edaa6dda237e

Here, ``build-commands`` is an array containing the commands required to
build and install the module. As can be seen, in this case ``pip`` is run to
do this. Here, the ``--prefix=/app`` option is important, because otherwise
``pip`` would try to install the module under ``/usr/`` which, because
``/usr/`` is mounted read-only inside the sandbox, would fail.

Note that ``--no-deps`` is only used for the purpose of the example - since the
requests module has its own dependencies, the build would fail. If multiple
dependencies are required, it is better to install them using the method in
the next section, instead.

Building multiple Python dependencies
-------------------------------------

Even though the example above installs, it won't actually work. This is because
the requests module has a number of dependencies that haven't been installed:

-  certifi
-  chardet
-  idna
-  urllib3

Four dependencies aren't very many, and could be installed using the
``simple`` method described above. However, anything more complex than this
would quickly become tedious.

For these cases, `flatpak-pip-generator
<https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/pip>`_ can
be used to generate the necessary manifest JSON. This is a Python script
that takes a package name and uses ``pip`` to identify its dependencies,
along with their tarball URLs and hashes.

Using ``flatpak-pip-generator`` is as simple as running::

    $ python3 flatpak-pip-generator requests

Or if you have a ``requirements.txt`` file you can generate modules for every
listed package::

    $ python3 flatpak-pip-generator --requirements-file=requirements.txt

This will output a file called ``python3-requests.json``, containing the
necessary manifest JSON, which can then be included in your application's
manifest file. Even if your manifest uses YAML, you can still include JSON
like this::

  modules:
    - python3-requests.json
    # (other modules go here)
