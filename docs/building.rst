Building
========

This section contains detailed information on how to build applications as
Flatpaks. It starts with an overview of the build process, before diving
into requirements for applications, guidance on key decisions, information
on how to use ``flatpak-builder``, and how to write manifest files.

If you haven't already, it is recommended to run through :doc:`first-build`
before reading this section.
