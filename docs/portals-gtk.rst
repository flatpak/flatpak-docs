Portal support in GTK
=====================

GTK will transparently use portals for some functionality when it detects that it is being
used inside a Flatpak sandbox. Here are some hints for what GTK applications should do to
benefit from this.

- Use ``g_get_user_config_dir()``, ``g_get_user_cache_dir()`` and ``g_get_user_data_dir()`` to find the right place to store configuration and data
- Use ``GtkFileChooserNative`` (or ``GtkFileChooserButton``) to open files. Note that portals cannot currently give access to directories on the host filesystem
- Use ``GtkPrintOperation`` for printing
- Use ``gtk_show_uri_on_window()`` or ``g_app_info_launch_default_for_uri()`` to open URIs
- Use ``gtk_application_inhibit()`` if you want to inhibit idle or logout
- Use ``g_application_send_notification()`` to show notifications
- Use the ``GtkApplication::screensaver-active`` property to monitor scrensaver status
