Qt
==

For Qt-based applications we have the ``org.kde.Platform`` runtime (and
corresponding ``org.kde.Sdk`` sdk runtime) that will offer us most Qt modules and
KDE Frameworks for our applications to use.

For example, the following YAML makes building a random Qt application really
straight-forward.

.. code-block:: yaml

  app-id: org.flatpak.qtdemo
  runtime: org.kde.Platform
  runtime-version: '5.15-22.08'
  sdk: org.kde.Sdk
  command: flatpak-demo
  finish-args:
    - --share=ipc
    - --socket=fallback-x11
    - --socket=wayland
    - --device=dri
  modules:
    - name: flatpak-demo
      buildsystem: cmake-ninja
      config-opts:

--------

The ``org.kde.Platform`` runtime includes all of Qt, including some KDE Frameworks. If you discover any issues we encourage you to `report them <https://invent.kde.org/packaging/flatpak-kde-runtime>`__. If you want more control, it's also possible to use the ``org.freedesktop.Platform`` as a base and bundle the parts of Qt you need.
