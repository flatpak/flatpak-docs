Hosting a repository
====================

The section on :doc:`flatpak-builder` describes how to generate repositories.
The resulting repository can be hosted on a web server for consumption by
users.

Important details
-----------------

Flatpak repositories use archive-z2, meaning that they contain a single file
for each file in the application. This means that pull operations involve a lot
of HTTP requests. Since new requests can be slow, it is important to enable
HTTP keep-alive on the web server that is hosting your repository.

Flatpak supports something called static deltas. These are single files that
contain all the data needed to go between two revisions (or from nothing to a
revision). Creating such deltas will take up more space on the server, but will
make downloads much faster. This can be done with the ``build-update-repo
--generate-static-deltas`` option.

.flatpakrepo files
------------------

``.flatpakrepo`` files are a convenient way to let users add a repository.
These are simple description files which contain information about the
repository. For example, the Flathub repo file looks like::

  [Flatpak Repo]
  Title=Flathub
  Url=https://dl.flathub.org/repo/
  Homepage=https://flathub.org/
  Comment=Central repository of Flatpak applications
  Description=Central repository of Flatpak applications
  Icon=https://dl.flathub.org/repo/logo.svg
  GPGKey=mQINBFlD2sABEADsiUZUO...

Here you can see that the repo file contains descriptive metadata, such as the
repository name, description, icon and website. The file also contains
information that is needed to add the repository, including a download URL and
the repository's GPG key.

``.flatpakrepo`` files can be used to add a repository from the command line.
For example, the command to add Flathub using its repo file is::

  $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

The command line isn't the only way to add a repository using a
``.flatpakrepo`` file - on desktops that support Flatpak, it is just a matter
of clicking the repository file or a download link that points to it.

.. note::

  ``.flatpakrepo`` files should include the base64-encoded version of the GPG
  key that was used to sign the repository. This can be obtained with the
  following command::

  $ base64 --wrap=0 < key.gpg
