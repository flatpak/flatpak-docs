Hosting a repository
====================

.. note::

  Flathub uses flat-manager to host its Flatpak repository. See
  https://github.com/flatpak/flat-manager

The section on :doc:`flatpak-builder` describes how to generate
repositories. The resulting repository can be hosted on a web server for
consumption by users.

Important details
-----------------

Flatpak repositories use archive-z2, meaning that they contain a single file
for each file in the application. This means that pull operations involve
a lot of HTTP requests. Since new requests can be slow, it is important to
enable HTTP keep-alive on the web server that is hosting your repository.

Flatpak supports something called static deltas. These are single files that
contain all the data needed to go between two revisions (or from nothing to
a revision). Creating such deltas will take up more space on the server,
but will make downloads much faster. This can be done with the ``flatpak
build-update-repo --generate-static-deltas`` option.

.flatpakrepo files
------------------

``.flatpakrepo`` files are a convenient way to let users add a
repository. These are simple description files which contain information
about the repository. For example, the Flathub repo file looks like::

  [Flatpak Repo]
  Title=Flathub
  Url=https://dl.flathub.org/repo/
  Homepage=https://flathub.org/
  Comment=Central repository of Flatpak applications
  Description=Central repository of Flatpak applications
  Icon=https://dl.flathub.org/repo/logo.svg
  GPGKey=mQINBFlD2sABEADsiUZUO...

Here you can see that the repo file contains descriptive metadata, such as
the repository name, description, icon and website. The file also contains
information that is needed to add the repository, including a download URL
and the repository's GPG key.

``.flatpakrepo`` files can be used to add a repository from the command
line. For example, the command to add Flathub using its repo file is::

  $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

The command line isn't the only way to add a repository using a
``.flatpakrepo`` file - on desktops that support Flatpak, it is just a matter
of clicking the repository file or a download link that points to it.

.. note::

  ``.flatpakrepo`` files should include the base64-encoded version of the
  GPG key that was used to sign the repository. This can be obtained with
  the following command::

  $ base64 --wrap=0 < key.gpg
