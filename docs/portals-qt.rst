Portal support in Qt and KDE
=============================

Qt and KDE libraries will transparently use portals for some functionality when they detect that
they are being used inside a Flatpak sandbox. Here are some hints for what Qt or KDE applications
should do to benefit from this.

- Use ``QDesktopServices::openUrl(const QUrl &url)`` or ``KIO::KRun`` to open URIs or send an email when using ``mailto`` URL
- Use ``QFileDialog`` class to open files. Avoid using ``QFileDialog::DontUseNativeDialog``. Note that portals cannot currently give access to directories on the host filesystem
- Use ``KNotification::notify()`` to show notification
