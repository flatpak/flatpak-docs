Portal support in Qt and KDE
=============================

Qt and KDE libraries will transparently use portals for some functionality when
they detect that they are being used inside a Flatpak sandbox. Here are some
hints for what Qt or KDE applications should do to benefit from this.

- Use ``QDesktopServices::openUrl(const QUrl &url)`` or ``KIO::OpenUrlJob`` to
  open URIs or send an email when using ``mailto`` URL
- Use ``QFileDialog`` class to open files and, as of Qt ``5.18.90``, directories. Avoid using
  ``QFileDialog::DontUseNativeDialog``. Note that portals cannot currently
  give access to directories on the host filesystem
- Use ``KNotification::notify()`` to show notification
