Available Runtimes
==================

This page provides information about available Flatpak runtimes. It is
primarily intended as information for application developers and distributors.

There are currently three main runtimes available: Freedesktop, GNOME and
KDE. These are all hosted on `Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_. Each runtime
comes with the corresponding SDK for building, and extensions for specific uses.

What is mentioned here is just a high level look at the contents. To have up
to date information simply install the runtime and open a shell inside of it
(``flatpak run org.freedesktop.Sdk//22.08``) from there you can look around or
use tools like ``pkg-config --list-all``. In the runtime shell you can also
inspect ``/usr/manifest.json``, which lists the sources used to build it.

Freedesktop
-----------

The Freedesktop runtime is the standard runtime that can be used for any
application and contains a set of essential libraries and services, including
D-Bus, GLib, Gtk3, PulseAudio, X11 and Wayland.

The Freedesktop runtime is maintained `here
<https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/>`__ and has a website
`here <https://freedesktop-sdk.io/>`__.

Available Freedesktop runtimes:
