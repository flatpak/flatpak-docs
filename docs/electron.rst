Electron
========

Due to the nature of Electron, building Electron applications as Flatpaks
requires a few extra steps compared with other applications. Thankfully,
several tools and resources are available which make this much easier.

This guide provides information on how building Electron applications differs
from other applications. It also includes information on the tooling for
building Electron applications and how to use it.

The guide walks through the `manifest file
<https://github.com/flathub/electron-sample-app/blob/master/flatpak/org.flathub.electron-sample-app.yml>`_
of the `sample Electron Flatpak application
<https://github.com/flathub/electron-sample-app>`_. Before you start,
it is a good idea to take a look at this, either online or by downloading
the application.


Building the sample application
-------------------------------

While it isn't strictly necessary, you might want to try building and running
the sample application yourself.

To get setup for the build, download or clone the sample app from GitHub,
and navigate to the ``/flatpak`` directory in the terminal. You must also
install the Electron base app and the Node.js SDK extension::

  $ flatpak install flathub org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp//23.08
  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.node18//23.08

Then you can run the build::

  $ flatpak-builder build org.flathub.electron-sample-app.yml --install --force-clean --user

Finally, the application can be run with::

  $ flatpak run org.flathub.electron-sample-app

Basic configuration
-------------------

The first part of the sample application's manifest specifies the application's
ID. It also configures the runtime and SDK:

.. code-block:: yaml

  id: org.flathub.electron-sample-app
  runtime: org.freedesktop.Platform
  runtime-version: '23.08'
  sdk: org.freedesktop.Sdk

The Freedesktop runtime is generally the best runtime to use with Electron
applications, since it is the most minimal runtime, and other dependencies
will be specific to Electron itself.

The Electron base app
---------------------

Next, the manifest specifies that the Electron base app should be used, by
specifying the ``base`` and ``base-version`` properties in the application
manifest:

.. code-block:: yaml

  base: org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp
  base-version: '23.08'

Base apps are described in :doc:`dependencies`.  Using the Electron base
app is much faster and more convenient than manually building Electron
dependencies. It also has the advantage of reducing the amount of duplication
on users' machines, since it means that Electron is only saved once on disk.

The Node.js SDK extension
-------------------------

In order to build Electron-based apps, you need Node.js available at build time.
Flathub provides Node.js LTS versions as extensions for the SDK, so you can
install one of them and add it in your apps' manifest:

.. code-block:: yaml

  sdk-extensions:
    - org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.node18

Enable the extension by adding it to ``PATH``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  build-options:
    append-path: /usr/lib/sdk/node18/bin

Note that the extension name (last portion of reverse-dns notation, ``node18``
in this example) must be the same in ``sdk-extensions`` and ``append-path``.

Command
-------

The ``command`` property indicates that a script called ``run.sh`` is to be
executed to run the application. This will be explained in further detail
later.

.. code-block:: yaml

  command: run.sh

Sandbox permissions
-------------------

The standard guidelines on sandbox permissions apply to Electron
applications. However, Electron does not use Wayland by default. So for
display access, only X11 should be used as the default configuration.
This will make Electron use Xwayland in a wayland session and nothing
else is required.

The sample app also configures pulseaudio for sound and enables network
access.

.. code-block:: yaml

  finish-args:
    - --share=ipc
    - --socket=x11
    - --socket=pulseaudio
    - --share=network

.. note::

  Native wayland support in electron is experimental and often unstable.
  It is advised to stick with the X11 and Xwayland configuration above
  as the default.

To enable experimental `native Wayland` support in Electron>=20, the
``--ozone-platform-hint=auto`` flag can be passed to the program. `auto`
will choose Wayland when the seesion is wayland and Xwayland or X11 
otherwise.

The recommended option is to leave it to the user. So ``--socket=x11``
should be used in manifest and Wayland can be tested with::

  flatpak run --socket=wayland org.flathub.electron-sample-app

To make native wayland the `default` for users ``--socket=fallback-x11``
and ``--socket=wayland`` must be used in the manifest.

Client-side window decorations in native wayland can be enabled by
passing ``--enable-features=WaylandWindowDecorations`` (Electron>=17).

Electron uses ``libnotify`` on Linux to provide desktop notifications.
libnotify `since 0.8.0 <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnotify/-/merge_requests/27>`_
automatically uses the `notification portal <https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Notification.html>`_
when inside a sandboxed environment and ``--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Notifications``
is not required.

``org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp`` since ``branch/23.08`` comes with
``libnotify>=0.8.0``

Build options
-------------

These build options aren't strictly necessary, but can be useful if something
goes wrong.
``env`` allows setting an array of environment variables, in this case we set
``NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL`` to ``info`` so that ``npm`` gives us more detailed
error messages.

.. code-block:: yaml

  build-options:
    cflags: -O2 -g
    cxxflags: -O2 -g
    env:
      NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL: info


The application module
----------------------

The final section of the manifest defines how the application module should
be built. This is where some of the additional logic for Electron and Node.js
can be found.

By default, ``flatpak-builder`` doesn't allow build tools to access the
network. This means that tools which rely on downloading sources will not
work. Therefore, Node.js packages must be downloaded prior to running the
build. Setting the  ``electron_config_cache`` environment variable means
that these will be found when it comes to the build.

The next part of the manifest describes how the application should be
built. The simple buildsystem option is used, which allows a sequence of
commands to be specified, which are used for the build. The download location
and hash of the application are also specified.

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: electron-sample-app
  buildsystem: simple
  build-options:
    env:
      XDG_CACHE_HOME: /run/build/electron-sample-app/flatpak-node/cache
      npm_config_cache: /run/build/electron-sample-app/flatpak-node/npm-cache
      npm_config_nodedir: /usr/lib/sdk/node18
      npm_config_offline: 'true'
  subdir: main
  sources:
    - type: archive
      url: https://github.com/flathub/electron-sample-app/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz
      sha256: a2feb3f1cf002a2e4e8900f718cc5c54db4ad174e48bfcfbddcd588c7b716d5b
      dest: main

Bundling NPM packages
---------------------

The next line is how NPM modules get bundled as part of Flatpaks:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - generated-sources.json

Since even simple Node.js applications depend on dozens of packages, it would
be impractical to specify all of them as part of a manifest file. A `Python
script <https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/node>`__
has therefore been developed to download Node.js packages with NPM or Yarn and
include them in an application's sources.

The Python script requires a ``package-lock.json`` (or ``yarn.lock``) file. This
file contains information about the packages that an application depends on, and
can be generated by running ``npm install --package-lock-only`` from an
application's root directory. The script is then run as follows::

  $ python3 flatpak-node-generator.py npm --xdg-layout package-lock.json

This generates the manifest JSON needed to build the NPM/Yarn
packages for the application, which are outputted to a file called
``generated-sources.json``. The content of this file can be copied to
the application's manifest but, because it is often very long, it is
often best to link to it from the main manifest, which is done by adding
``generated-source.json`` as a line in the manifest section, as seen above.

Launching the app
-----------------

The Electron app is run through a simple script. This can be given any name
but must be specified in the manifest's ``"command":`` property. See below
a sample wrapper for launching app:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - type: script
    dest-filename: run.sh
    commands:
      - zypak-wrapper.sh /app/main/electron-sample-app "$@"

Build commands
--------------

Last but not least, since the simple build option is being used, a list of
build commands must be provided. As can be seen, ``npm`` is run with the
``npm_config_offline=true`` environment variable, installing dependencies from
packages that have already been cached. These are copied to ``/app/main/``.
Finally the ``run.sh`` script is installed to ``/app/bin/`` so that it will be
on ``$PATH``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    build-commands:
      # Install npm dependencies
      - npm install --offline
      # Build the app; in this example the `dist` script
      # in package.json runs electron-builder
      - |
        . ../flatpak-node/electron-builder-arch-args.sh
        npm run dist -- $ELECTRON_BUILDER_ARCH_ARGS  --linux --dir
      # Bundle app and dependencies
      - cp -a dist/linux*unpacked /app/main
      # Install app wrapper
      - install -Dm755 -t /app/bin/ ../run.sh

Note that if the application you are trying to package contains a ``build`` block in ``package.json`` with instructions for Linux, this can cause ``electron-builder`` to try to fetch additional binaries at build-time (Even if `--dir` option is used). The following example shows a configuration that will try to download AppImage binaries:

.. code-block:: json

  "build": {
    "linux": {
      "target": "AppImage",
    }
  }

The preferred way of fixing this, is not a patch, but a build-time edit using ``jq``. The following command will replace ``"target": "AppImage"`` with ``"target": "dir"``:

.. code-block:: bash

  jq '.build.linux.target="dir"' <<<$(<package.json) > package.json
