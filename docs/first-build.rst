Building your first Flatpak
===========================

This tutorial provides a quick introduction to building Flatpaks. In it,
you will learn how to create a basic Flatpak application, which can be
installed and run.

In order to complete this tutorial, you should have followed the `setup guide
on flatpak.org <https://flatpak.org/setup/>`_. You also need to have installed
``flatpak-builder``, which is usually available from the same repository as
the ``flatpak`` package (e.g. use ``apt`` or ``dnf``). You can also install
it as a flatpak with ``flatpak install flathub org.flatpak.Builder``.

1. Install a runtime and the matching SDK
-----------------------------------------

Flatpak requires every app to specify a runtime that it uses for its basic
dependencies. Each runtime has a matching SDK (Software Development Kit), which
contains all the things that are in the runtime, plus headers and development
tools. This SDK is required to build apps for the runtime.

In this tutorial we will use the Freedesktop 23.08 runtime and SDK. To
install these, run::

  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//23.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//23.08

2. Create the app
-----------------

The app that is going to be created for this tutorial is a simple script. To
create it, copy the following::

  #!/bin/sh
  echo "Hello world, from a sandbox"

Now paste this into an empty file and save it as ``hello.sh``.

3. Add a manifest
-----------------

Each Flatpak is built using a manifest file which provides basic information
about the application and instructions for how it is to be built. To add a
manifest to the hello world app, add the following to an empty file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  app-id: org.flatpak.Hello
  runtime: org.freedesktop.Platform
  runtime-version: '23.08'
  sdk: org.freedesktop.Sdk
  command: hello.sh
  modules:
    - name: hello
      buildsystem: simple
      build-commands:
        - install -D hello.sh /app/bin/hello.sh
      sources:
        - type: file
          path: hello.sh

Now save the file alongside ``hello.sh`` and call it
``org.flatpak.Hello.yml``.

In a more complex application, the manifest would list multiple modules. The
last one would typically be the application itself, and the earlier ones would
be dependencies that are bundled with the app because they are not part of the
runtime.

4. Build the application
------------------------

Now that the app has a manifest, ``flatpak-builder`` can be used to build it.
This is done by specifying the manifest file and a target directory::

  $ flatpak-builder build-dir org.flatpak.Hello.yml

This command will build each module that is listed in the manifest and install
it to the ``/app`` subdirectory, inside the ``build-dir`` directory.

5. Test the build
-----------------

To verify that the build was successful, run the following::

  $ flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir org.flatpak.Hello.yml
  $ flatpak run org.flatpak.Hello

This second time we passed in ``--force-clean``, which means that the
previously created ``build-dir`` directory was deleted before the new build was
started.

Congratulations, you've made an app!

6. Put the app in a repository
------------------------------

If you want to share the application you can put it in a
repository. This is done by passing the ``--repo`` argument to
``flatpak-builder``::

 $ flatpak-builder --repo=repo --force-clean build-dir org.flatpak.Hello.yml

This does the build again, and at the end exports the result to a local
directory called ``repo``. Note that ``flatpak-builder`` keeps a cache of
previous builds in the ``.flatpak-builder`` subdirectory, so doing a second
build like this is very fast.

In order for your application to show up in application stores while testing with a local repository, you might have
to run ``flatpak build-update-repo repo``.
For more information how to publish to application stores see `Appdata files <https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/freedesktop-quick-reference.html#appdata-files>`_.

7. Install the app
------------------

Now we're ready to add the repository that was just created and install the
app. This is done with two commands::

  $ flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify tutorial-repo repo
  $ flatpak --user install tutorial-repo org.flatpak.Hello

The first command adds the repository that was created in the previous step.
The second command installs the app from the repository.

Both these commands use the ``--user`` argument, which means that the
repository and the app are added per-user rather than system-wide. This is
useful for testing.

Note that the repository was added with ``--no-gpg-verify``, since a GPG key
wasn't specified when the app was built. This is fine for testing, but for
official repositories you should sign them with a private GPG key.

8. Run the app
--------------

All that's left is to try the app. This can be done with the following
command::

  $ flatpak run org.flatpak.Hello

This runs the app, so that it prints 'Hello world, from a sandbox'.
