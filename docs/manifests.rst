Manifests
=========

The input to ``flatpak-builder`` is a JSON or YAML file that describes the
parameters for building an application, as well as instructions for each of
the modules that are to be built. This file is called the manifest.

This page provides information and guidance on how to use manifests, including
an explanation of the most common parameters that can be specified. It is
recommended to have followed the :doc:`first-build` tutorial before reading
this section, and to be familiar with :doc:`flatpak-builder`.

Manifest files should be named using the application ID. For example, the
manifest file for GNOME Dictionary is named ``org.gnome.Dictionary.yml``. This
page uses this manifest file for all its examples.

A complete list of all the properties that can be specified in manifest files
can be found in the :doc:`flatpak-builder-command-reference`, as well as the
``flatpak-manifest`` man page.

Basic properties
----------------

Each manifest file should specify basic information about the application that
is to be built, including the ``id``, ``runtime``, ``runtime-version``,
``sdk`` and ``command`` parameters. These properties are typically specified
at the beginning of the file.

For example, the GNOME Dictionary manifest includes:

.. code-block:: yaml

  id: org.gnome.Dictionary
  runtime: org.gnome.Platform
  runtime-version: '45'
  sdk: org.gnome.Sdk
  command: gnome-dictionary

Specifying a runtime and runtime version allows that the runtime that is
needed by your application to be automatically installed on users' systems.

File renaming
-------------

Exports are application files that are made available to the host, and include
things like the application's ``.desktop`` file and icon.

The names of files that are exported by a Flatpak must be prefixed using the
application ID, such as ``org.gnome.Dictionary.desktop``. The best way to
do this is to rename these files directly in the application's source.

If renaming exported files to use the application ID is not possible,
``flatpak-builder`` allows them to be renamed as part of the build
process. This can be done by specifying one of the following properties in
the manifest:

- ``rename-icon`` - rename the application icon
- ``rename-desktop-file`` - rename the ``.desktop`` filename
- ``rename-appdata-file`` - rename the MetaInfo file

Each of these properties accepts the name of the source file to be
renamed. ``flatpak-builder`` then automatically renames the file to match
the application ID. Note that this renaming method can introduce internal
naming conflicts, and that renaming files in tree is therefore the most
reliable approach.

Finishing
---------

Applications that are run with Flatpak have extremely limited access to the
host environment by default, but applications require access to resources
outside of their sandbox in order to be useful. Finishing is the build stage
where the application's sandbox permissions are specified, in order to give
access to these resources.

The finishing manifest section uses the ``finish-args`` property, which can
be seen in the Dictionary manifest file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  finish-args:
    # X11 + XShm access
    - --share=ipc
    - --socket=fallback-x11
    # Wayland access
    - --socket=wayland
    # GPU acceleration if needed
    - --device=dri
    # Needs to talk to the network:
    - --share=network
    # Needs to save files locally
    - --filesystem=xdg-documents

Guidance on which permissions to use can be found in the
:doc:`sandbox-permissions`.

Cleanup
-------

The cleanup property can be used to remove files produced by the build process
that are not wanted as part of the application, such as headers or developer
documentation. Two properties in the manifest file are used for this.
This can be either done for each modules in which case only names created
by that module will be matched or at the toplevel which will match
anything created in the entire manifest.

Items starting with `/` are taken to be relative to the prefix, so
``/include`` will cleanup ``/app/include``, otherwise it matches the
basename.

First, a list of filename patterns can be included::

  cleanup:
    - '/include'
    - '/bin/foo-*'
    - '*.a'

A cleanup with ``*``, at the `module level` will cleanup all artifacts
built from that module. This is often useful for build dependencies of
a module that does not need to be shipped in the final Flatpak package::

  cleanup:
    - '*'

The `cleanup-commands` property can be a list of cleanup commands::

  cleanup-commands:
    - 'find /app/bin -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1  -name 'rpm*' ! -name 'rpm2cpio' -delete'

Note that, instead of cleaning up unnecessary files, it is often better
to build less components through ``config-opts, build-commands, make-args``.
For example, if the application does not need documentation files or
manpages, it's best to stop building them. This should make the build
faster in some cases and reduce the need for excessive cleanups.

Modules
-------

The module list specifies each of the modules that are to be built as part
of the build process. One of these modules is the application itself, and
other modules are dependencies and libraries that are bundled as part of
the Flatpak. While simple applications may only specify one or two modules,
and therefore have short modules sections, some applications can bundle
numerous modules and therefore have lengthy modules sections.

Modules are built in the order they are declared in the manifest. If any
module changes, that module and all the subsequent modules below it will
be rebuilt, otherwise it should use the cache.

The general recommendation is to place the "main" module, usually the
module for the main application as the last module in the manifest but
if there is a module which gets updated often and is independent from the
rest, that module can also be placed as the last module to avoid
rebuilding everything else.

Modules can either be nested to clearly show the dependency structure
or be linearly declared.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - --share=ipc
    - --socket=fallback-x11

As can be seen, each listed module has a ``name`` (which can be freely
assigned) and a list of ``sources``. Each source has a ``type``, and available
types include:

 - ``archive`` - ``.tar`` or ``.zip`` archive files
 - ``git`` - Git repositories
 - ``bzr`` - Bazaar repositories
 - ``file`` - local/remote files (these are copied into the source directory)
 - ``dir`` - local directories (these are copied into the source directory)
 - ``script`` - an array of shell commands (these are put in a shellscript
   file)
 - ``shell`` - an array of shell commands that are run during source extraction
 - ``patch`` - a patch (are applied to the source directory)
 - ``extra-data`` - data that can be downloaded at install time; this can
   include archive or package files

Different properties are available for each source type, which are listed
in the :doc:`module-sources`.

Supported build systems
```````````````````````

Modules can be built with a variety of build systems, including:

- `autotools <https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html>`_
- `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_
- `cmake-ninja <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/generator/Ninja.html>`_
- `meson <https://mesonbuild.com/>`_
- `qmake <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-overview.html>`_
- the "`Build API <https://github.com/cgwalters/build-api/>`_"

A "simple" build method is also available, which allows a series of commands
to be specified.

Shared Modules
``````````````

Flathub contains a `shared modules <https://github.com/flathub/shared-modules>`_
repository containing build manifests for commonly used modules. These
are usally shared by apps on Flathub and maintained in a single place.
The repository is intended to be used as a git submodule.

Please see the `readme <https://github.com/flathub/shared-modules/blob/master/README.md>`_
for details on how to use this.

Flatpak Builder Tools
`````````````````````

`Flatpak Builder Tools (or flatpak-builder-tools) <https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools>`_ is a collection of scripts to aid using `flatpak-builder`. In this repository, each directory contains instructions to generate a manifest for the respective platform.

Example manifests
-----------------

Flathub hosts a large collection of applications and the respective
manifests can be browsed and searched via `GitHub <https://github.com/flathub>`_.
