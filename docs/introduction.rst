Introduction to Flatpak
=======================

Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications on Linux. It
has been created by developers who have a long history of working on the
Linux desktop, and is run as an independent open source project.

Target audience
---------------

Flatpak can be used by all kinds of desktop applications, and aims to be
as agnostic as possible regarding how applications are built. There are no
requirements regarding which programming languages, build tools, toolkits
or frameworks can be used.

While Flatpak only runs on Linux, it can be used by applications that target
other operating systems, as well as those that are Linux-specific. Applications
can be open source or proprietary (although some distribution services, like
`Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, can have restrictions in this respect).

The only technical requirements made by Flatpak are that applications follow a
small number of Freedesktop standards, in order to enable desktop integration
(see :doc:`conventions`).

Issues of current model of packaging
------------------------------------

It is important to understand the problems of the current model
of packaging applications to understand the existence of Flatpak:

- **Duplicated work packaging apps**: many Linux distributions come with their own package
  manager, package format and repository. This requires a lot of maintainers to package the
  same application in various distributions, or the application developer to learn the
  language of each format and then package the application in those distributions, or
  ignore most distributions and package and support a couple of distributions. This makes
  the Linux desktop a difficult platform for software vendors to target.
- **Limited to apps that are packaged**: not all applications are natively available
  in every Linux distribution. If an application is not available in a specific
  distribution, the user will have to rely on manually downloading the archive
  of the application, extracting it and hoping the application will launch.
- **Limited to distributions that have the apps**: the user is limited to the
  number of distributions that have the needed applications for them
  to properly setup their workflow. This reduces the amount of distributions
  that can be suitable for a user.
- **Hard to innovate in OS space**: the maintainers of the distributions have to spend a lot of
  time packaging applications to make the distribution suitable for the end user, instead of focusing
  on their end goals. This delays the progress of each distribution.
- **Old and outdated packages**: LTS distributions often have very old versions of applications
  packaged natively. Bug reproducibility is hindered by the different environments that applications
  are run in, and application developers often have little control over how their application is
  packaged by distributions.

Flatpak strives to fix the issues listed above, by conveniently enabling developers to distribute
applications from one source and to target the entire Linux desktop.

Reasons to use Flatpak
----------------------

Flatpak has some major advantages over most system package managers:

- **Universality**: Flatpak allows applications to be installed and run on virtually any Linux
  distribution. This includes non-GNU distributions, systemd-free distributions,
  distributions with a read-only operating system (OS), and various architectures without the
  developer needing the relevant hardware on hand.
- **Space for innovations**: Flatpak facilitates distribution maintainers to focus on their goals
  to innovate their distribution.
- **Stability**: breakage in a Flatpak application will not risk the system from breaking.
  This is because Flatpak applications and runtimes are contained to not interfere
  with the system altogether.
- **Rootless install**: elevated privileges are not required when installing a Flatpak
  application or a runtime.
- **Sandboxed applications**: one of Flatpak's main goals is to increase the security of desktop
  systems by isolating applications from one another. This is achieved using sandboxing and means
  that, by default, applications that are run with Flatpak have limited access to the host environment.

Flatpak has some major advantages over other universal approaches to distributing
applications on Linux:

- **Decentralized by design**: while Flatpak does provide a centralized service for distributing
  applications, it also allows decentralized hosting and distribution, so that
  application developers or downstreams can host their own applications and
  application repositories.
- **Desktop integration**: Flatpak also offers native integration for the main Linux desktops, so that
  users can easily browse, install, run and use Flatpak applications through
  their existing desktop environment and tools.
- **Space efficiency**: Flatpak deduplicates libraries and other files used by multiple
  applications to save to save megabytes or even gigabytes worth of storage depending on
  the amount of applications installed.
- **Delta updates**: only changed files are downloaded for updates.

Other benefits for developers include:

- **Forward-compatibility**: the same Flatpak application can be run on different versions
  of the same distribution, including versions that haven't been released
  yet. This doesn't require any changes or management by application developers.
- **Bundling**: this allows application developers to ship almost any
  dependency or library as part of their application. This gives complete
  control over which software is used to build applications.
- **Consistent application environments**: because these are the same across
  devices, applications perform as intended. This also makes it easier to
  identify bugs and to do testing.
- **Branches**: this allows developers to ship applications from different
  branches, e.g. ``stable``, ``beta``, etc. while retaining the same name.
- **Maintained platforms**: called runtimes, these contain collections of
  dependencies, which can be used by applications, and which can take a lot
  of the work out of application development.
