Introduction to Flatpak
=======================

Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications on Linux. It has
been created by developers who have a long history of working on the Linux
desktop, and is run as an independent open source project.

Target audience
---------------

Flatpak can be used by all kinds of desktop applications, and aims to be as
agnostic as possible regarding how applications are built. There are no
requirements regarding which programming languages, build tools, toolkits or
frameworks can be used.

While Flatpak only runs on Linux, it can be used by applications that target
other operating systems, as well as those that are Linux-specific. Applications
can be open source or proprietary (although some distribution services, like
`Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, can have restrictions in this respect).

The only technical requirements made by Flatpak are that applications follow a
small number of Freedesktop standards, in order to enable desktop integration
(see :doc:`conventions`).

Reasons to use Flatpak
----------------------

Flatpak has some major advantages over other approaches to distributing
applications on Linux. First and foremost, Flatpak allows a single application
build to be installed and run on virtually any Linux distribution. It can also
be used in combination with `Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, a centralized
service for distributing applications on all distributions. This makes it
possible for application developers to target the entire Linux desktop market
from one place.

Flatpak also offers native integration for the main Linux desktops, so that
users can easily browse, install, run and use Flatpak applications through
their existing desktop environment and tools.

Other benefits for developers include:

- **Forward-compatibility:** the same Flatpak can be run on different versions
  of the same distribution, including versions that haven't been released yet.
  This doesn't require any changes or management by application developers.
- **Maintained platforms:** called runtimes, these contain collections of
  dependencies, which can be used by applications, and which can take a lot of
  the work out of application development.
- **Bundling:** this allows application developers to ship almost any
  dependency or library as part of their application. This gives complete
  control over which software is used to build applications.
- **Consistent application environments:** because these are the same across
  devices, applications perform as intended. This also makes it easier to
  identify bugs and to do testing.

Finally, while Flatpak does provide a centralized service for distributing
applications, it also allows decentralized hosting and distribution, so that
application developers or downstreams can host their own applications and
application repositories.

Information about Flatpak's internals can be found in :doc:`under-the-hood`.
