Getting Started
===============

This section includes an introduction to basic Flatpak concepts, a guide on
how to use the Flatpak command line interface, and a tutorial for building
a simple application.

To complete this section, Flatpak should have been installed and
the Flathub repository should have been enabled. The Flatpak website
provides `instructions for how to do this with a range of distributions
<https://flatpak.org/setup/>`_.
