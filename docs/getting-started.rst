Getting Started
===============

This section provides information on how to take your first steps with Flatpak. It includes an introduction to basic Flatpak concepts, a short guide on how to use the ``flatpak`` command, and a tutorial for building a simple application.

To complete this section, Flatpak should have been installed and the Flathub repository should have been enabled. The Flatpak website provides `instructions for how to do this with a range of distributions <https://flatpak.org/setup/>`_.
