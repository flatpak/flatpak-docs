Welcome to Flatpak's documentation!
===================================

These docs cover everything you need to know to build and distribute
applications using Flatpak. They begin with a basic introduction to Flatpak,
background information on basic concepts, and a guide to the Flatpak command
line interface. Later sections provide detailed information on building and
distributing applications.

The docs are primarily intended for application developers and
distributors. Their content is also relevant to those who have a general
interest in Flatpak.

run applications, please refer to `the Flatpak website <https://flatpak.org>`_.
