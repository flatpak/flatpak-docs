Publishing
==========

Flatpak provides several ways to distribute applications to users. For many
applications, the most convenient and effective method is to use `Flathub
<https://flathub.org>`_, which provides a large centralized repository of
Flatpak applications.

Alternatively, it is possible to host a repository yourself, or to distribute
Flatpaks as single file bundles.
