USB Drives
==========

One can distribute flatpaks along with their dependencies on USB drives (or
network shares, etc.) which is especially helpful in situations where Internet
access is limited or non-existent.

For offline distribution to work there are a few prerequisites:

- the remote repositories providing the app or any of its dependencies must
  utilize GPG signatures
- the remote repos must all have a collection ID set on the server side
- the locally configured remotes must have a collection ID set (on the client
  side)
- the relevant remotes must be configured on the receiving computer (the one
  installing from the drive)

Apps can then be copied to USB drives using `the flatpak create-usb command
<https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak-create-usb>`_.
You can refer to `this blog
post <https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2018/08/26/about-flatpak-installations/>`__
for an introduction.

For example, if you want to put Gedit on a USB drive:

1. First identify the Application ID using ``flatpak list --app``.
   In the case of Gedit it is ``org.gnome.gedit``. Use ``flatpak info -o
   org.gnome.gedit`` to determine the origin remote. For example that may be
   ``flathub``.

2. Ensure the origin remote has a collection ID set by using ``flatpak remotes
   -d`` and checking the "Collection ID" column. If not, configure one with
   e.g. ``flatpak remote-modify --collection-id=org.flathub.Stable flathub``.
   If any dependencies come from other remotes, those will also need a
   collection ID configured.

3. Next, use the ``df`` command to identify the mount point for the USB
   drive. It may be something like ``/media/user/FLATPAKS``.

4. Now copy the flatpak and its dependencies to the drive::

    $ flatpak create-usb /media/user/FLATPAKS org.gnome.gedit

5. Wait for the copying process to complete, at which point you should get a
   command prompt (``$``). This process can take tens of minutes especially if
   the USB drive and USB port aren't USB 3.0+. Then unmount the drive before
   removing it::

    $ umount /media/user/FLATPAKS


The process for installing from such a USB drive (for example on an offline
machine) differs between Flatpak versions before 1.8.0 and those after. With
earlier versions you can simply use the ``flatpak install`` command as you
normally would online::

   $ flatpak install flathub org.gnome.gedit

For versions after 1.8.0, if your linux
distribution has packaged `the relevant systemd units
<https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/tree/main/sideload-repos-systemd>`__,
using ``flatpak install`` with no extra arguments still works. Otherwise, you
can use the ``--sideload-repo`` option in your command invocation::

   $ flatpak install --sideload-repo=/media/user/FLATPAKS/.ostree/repo flathub org.gnome.gedit

The ``flatpak update`` command also accepts a ``--sideload-repo`` option.

Alternatively, it's possible to specify sideload sources using symbolic links
placed in system-wide or user-specific directories and such sources will then
be used for all Flatpak operations without the need for a ``--sideload-repo``
option. See `the flatpak man page
<https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak>`__.
