Building Introduction
=====================

:doc:`first-build` has already provided a quick demonstration of how
applications get built with Flatpak. This page provides an additional general
overview of what's involved.

.. note::

  App stores like `Flathub <https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission>`_
  have additional requirements on the building process. Please refer to
  their respective documentation for details.

flatpak-builder
---------------

``flatpak-builder`` is the primary tool for building Flatpak applications. It
allows you to take the source files for an application and build it into a
Flatpak application. It also allows multiple other dependencies to be built
at the same time, which get bundled into the build.

It is packaged by several distributions and there is also a
`Flatpak package <https://flathub.org/apps/org.flatpak.Builder>`_ called
``org.flatpak.Builder`` available for it on Flathub (this may contain
Flathub specific downstream modifications).

The input to ``flatpak-builder`` is a manifest file. This specifies the
parameters for the application that will be built, such as its name and
which runtime it will depend on. The manifest also lists all the modules
that are to be built as part of the build process. A source for each module
can be specified, including links to file archives or version control
repositories. One of the modules (usually the last one) is the application
code itself.

The basic format used to invoke ``flatpak-builder`` is::

 $ flatpak-builder <build-dir> <manifest>

Where ``<build-dir>`` is the path to the directory that the application
will be built into, and ``<manifest>`` is the path to a manifest file. The
contents of ``<build-dir>`` can be useful for testing and debugging purposes,
but is generally treated as an artifact of the build process.

When ``flatpak-builder`` is run:

- The build directory is created, if it doesn't already exist
- The source code for each module is downloaded and verified
- The source code for each module is built and installed
- The build is finished by setting sandbox permissions
- The build result is exported to a repository (which will be created if it
  doesn't exist already)

The application can then be installed from the repository and run.

Software Development Kits (SDKs)
--------------------------------

Instead of being built using the host environment, Flatpak applications are
built inside a separate environment, called an SDK.

SDKs are like the regular runtime that applications run in. The difference
is that SDKs also include all the development resources and tools that are
required to build an application, such as build and packaging tools, header
files, compilers and debuggers.

Each runtime has an accompanying SDK. For example, there is both a GNOME
43 runtime and a GNOME 43 SDK. Applications that use the runtime are
built with the matching SDK.

Like runtimes, SDKs will sometimes be automatically installed for you, but
if you do need to manually install them, they are installed in the same way
as applications and runtimes, such as::

 $ flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Sdk//43
