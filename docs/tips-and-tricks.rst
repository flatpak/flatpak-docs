Tips and Tricks
===============

This page explains a few useful features of the Flatpak CLI.


Testing an app with a different runtime
---------------------------------------

You can (for testing) run an application with a different runtime than it
typically uses.  For instance, to run stable gedit with the latest unstable
gnome runtime you can do::

 $ flatpak run --runtime-version=master org.gnome.gedit

You can also use a completely different runtime (but same version number)::

 $ flatpak run --runtime=org.gnome.Sdk org.gnome.gedit

If you just want to use the sdk instead of the platform like the above, a
better approach is to use ``-d``.

.. warning::

  Running against a runtime with a completely different ABI is undefined and unsupported
  behavior.

Downgrading
-----------

It is possible to downgrade an installed application (or runtime) to an older
build.

First you look for the commit you are interested in::

 $ flatpak remote-info --log flathub org.gnome.Recipes

Then you deploy the commit::

 $ sudo flatpak update \
   --commit=ec07ad6c54e803d1428e5580426a41315e50a14376af033458e7a65bfb2b64f0 \
   org.gnome.Recipes

If you have Flatpak 1.5.0 or later, you can also prevent the app from being
included in updates (either manual or automatic)::

 $ flatpak mask org.gnome.Recipes


Bisecting regressions in application builds
-------------------------------------------

In case the newest builds of an application introduce regressions, you can use
``flatpak-bisect`` to discover which commit introduced the regression. It works
just like ``git bisect``.

In case your distribution doesn't install the ``flatpak-bisect`` utility, you
can find it distributed alongside the Flatpak source code, in
https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/master/scripts/flatpak-bisect

First you update the application and get its history::

  $ flatpak-bisect org.gnome.gedit start

Then, you should set the current commit as the first bad commit::

  $ flatpak-bisect org.gnome.gedit bad

Now you need to find the hash of the first known good commit. For that, you can
see the build history by running::

  $ flatpak-bisect org.gnome.gedit log

To start bisecting, checkout the first known good commit you find::

  $ flatpak-bisect org.gnome.gedit checkout 5cd2b0648618c9038fbc6830733817309ade29541cdd8383830bbb76f6accf0d

After setting the bad commit and the first known good commit, you can launch
the application to verify if the current commit in the bisecting session is
a good or a bad one.

To mark a commit as good or bad, run::

  $ flatpak-bisect org.gnome.gedit good

Or::

  $ flatpak-bisect org.gnome.gedit bad

``flatpak-bisect`` will inform you when the first bad commit is found.

Adding a custom installation
----------------------------

By default Flatpak installs apps system-wide, and can also be made to install
per-user with the ``--user`` option accepted by most commands. A third option
is to set up a custom installation, which could be stored on an external hard
drive.

First ensure that the config directory exists::

  $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/flatpak/installations.d

Then open a file in that directory as root::

  $ sudoedit /etc/flatpak/installations.d/extra.conf

And write something like this::

  [Installation "extra"]
  Path=/run/media/mwleeds/ext4_4tb/flatpak/
  DisplayName=Extra Installation
  StorageType=harddisk

See `flatpak-installation(5)
<http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak-installation>`_
for the full format specification. Replace the path with the actual path you
want to use. You can use ``df`` to see mounted file systems and ``mkdir`` to
create a ``flatpak`` directory so the path specified by ``Path=`` exists.

Then you can add a remote using a command like::

  $ flatpak --installation=extra remote-add flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

And install to it with::

  $ flatpak --installation=extra install flathub org.inkscape.Inkscape

.. note::

  If your custom installation is the only one with the remote you're installing
  from, ``--installation`` can be omitted.

And run apps from it with::

  $ flatpak --installation=extra run org.inkscape.Inkscape

.. note::

  If your custom installation is the only one with the app you're running,
  ``--installation`` can be omitted.
