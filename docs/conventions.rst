Requirements & Conventions
==========================

Flatpak deliberately makes as few requirements of applications as
possible. However, a small number of standard Linux desktop conventions
are expected, primarily to ensure that applications integrate with Linux
desktops and app centers. Developers might also encounter a small number of
Linux technical conventions.

Information on further desktop integration options can be found in
:doc:`desktop-integration`.

Expected Standards
------------------

Applications that use Flatpak are generally expected to comply with the
following standards. Applications that have previously targeted the Linux
desktop will typically need to make very few (if any) changes to do this.

Application IDs
```````````````

As described in :doc:`using-flatpak`, Flatpak requires each application to have a
unique identifier, which has a form such as ``org.gnome.Dictionary``.

The format is in reverse-DNS style so the first section should be a domain
controlled by the project and the trailing section represents the specific project.
There are some exceptions to this, such as extensions using the base application-id of the project
they extend rather than their own.

As will be seen below and in future sections, this ID is expected to be used in a number of places.
Developers must follow the standard `D-Bus naming conventions for bus names
<https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names>`_
when creating their own IDs. This format is
already recommended by the `Desktop File specification
<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#file-naming>`_
and `Appstream specification
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#sect-Metadata-GenericComponent>`_
also.

For some practical examples of bad IDs

- ``org.example.desktop``

  This is a bad ID because the Appstream standard for legacy reasons treats IDs ending with
  ``.desktop`` as a special case causing inconsistency. For this same reason, ``.Desktop`` suffixes
  should not be used for newly named applications. Don't hesitate to repeat the application name
  even if it already is part of the domain name section of the identifier (eg. ``org.example.Example``).
 
- ``io.github.Foo``
 
  This is problematic because while ``foo.github.io`` may be unique to your project, it does not
  include a project-specific identifier. This may cause issues if another project creates
  ``io.github.Foo-Bar`` which should be its own namespace but areas of ``flatpak`` may treat them
  similar. A better ID would be ``io.github.foo.Foo`` even if it is redundant.

- ``org.example-site.Foo``
  
  This ID is not valid according to the DBus specification. You can use ``org.example_site.Foo`` instead.

- ``com.github.foo.Bar``
 
  While a project may be hosted on GitHub it does not have any control over the ``github.com`` domain. Instead
  you should use ``io.github`` as shown above.

AppData files
`````````````
AppData files provide metadata about applications, which is
used by application stores (such as Flathub, GNOME Software
and KDE Discover). The `Freedesktop AppStream specification
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/>`_ provides a complete
reference for providing AppData.

AppData files should be named with the application ID and the ``.metainfo.xml``
file extension, and should be placed in ``/app/share/metainfo/``. For example::

  /app/share/metainfo/org.gnome.Dictionary.metainfo.xml

A legacy convention of having the ``.appdata.xml`` installed in ``/app/share/appdata``
is also accepted as well, and ``flatpak-builder`` will check either directory with
either extension.

The ``appstream-util validate-relax`` command can be used to check AppData
files for errors.

Application icons
`````````````````

Applications are expected to provide an application icon, which
is used for their application launcher. These icons should be
provided in accordance with the `Freedesktop icon specification
<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html>`_.

Icons should be named with the application's ID, be in either PNG or SVG
format, and must be placed in the standard location::

  /app/share/icons/hicolor/$size/apps/

For example, the path to the 128✕128px version of GNOME Dictionary's
icon is::

  /app/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/org.gnome.Dictionary.png

Icons must be square shaped, ie their width and height must be the
same. The maximum size allowed by the specification is 512x512px. SVG
icons are of size ``scalable``::

  /app/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/org.gnome.Dictionary.svg

Desktop files
`````````````

Desktop files are used to provide the desktop environment with
information about each application. The `Freedesktop specification
<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/>`_ provides a
complete reference for writing desktop files, and `additional information
about them <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries>`_ is
available online.

Desktop files should be named with the application's ID, followed
by the ``.desktop`` file extension, and should be placed in
``/app/share/applications/``. For example::

  /app/share/applications/org.gnome.Dictionary.desktop

A minimal desktop file should contain at least the application's *name*,
*exec* command, *type*, *icon* name and *categories*::

  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=Gnome Dictionary
  Exec=org.gnome.Dictionary
  Type=Application
  Icon=org.gnome.Dictionary
  Categories=GNOME;GTK;Office;Dictionary;

The ``desktop-file-validate`` command can be used to check for errors in
desktop files.

Exporting through extra-data
----------------------------

Files downloaded through ``extra-data`` are only downloaded when installing, as such they aren't yet available for ``flatpak-builder`` to automatically export during the build process.

When using ``extra-data``, place any files that must be exported under this location::

  /app/extra/export/share/

For example, if GNOME Dictionary used ``extra-data`` to download a 96x96 icon this would be its path::

  /app/extra/export/share/icons/hicolor/96x96/apps/org.gnome.Dictionary.png

Technical conventions
---------------------

The following are standard technical conventions used by Flatpak and
Linux desktops. Those with Linux experience will likely already be aware
of them. However, developers who are new to Linux might find some of this
information useful.

D-Bus
`````

D-Bus is the standard IPC framework used on Linux desktops. A lot of
applications won't need to use it, but it is supported by Flatpak should it
be required.

D-Bus can be used for application launching and communicating with some system
services. Applications can also provide their own D-Bus services (when doing
this, the D-Bus service name is expected to be the same as the application ID).

Filesystem layout
`````````````````

Each Flatpak sandbox, which is the environment in which an
application is run, contains the filesystem of the application's
runtime. This follows `standard Linux filesystem conventions
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard>`_.

For example, the root of the sandbox contains the ``/etc`` directory for
configuration files and ``/usr`` for multi-user utilities and applications. In
addition to this, each sandbox contains a top-level ``/app`` directory,
which is where the application's own files are located.

XDG base directories
--------------------

`XDG base directories
<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_ are
standard locations for user-specific application data. Popular toolkits provide
convenience functions for accessing XDG base directories. These include:

- Electron: XDG base directories can be accessed with ``app.getPath``
- Glib: provides access to the XDG base directories through
  the ``g_get_user_cache_dir ()``, ``g_get_user_data_dir ()``,
  ``g_get_user_config_dir ()`` functions
- Qt: provides access to XDG base directories with the `QStandardPaths
  Class <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandardpaths.html>`_

However, applications that aren't using one of these toolkits can expect to
find their XDG base directories in the following locations:

===============  =================================  ================================
Base directory   Usage                              Default location
===============  =================================  ================================
XDG_CONFIG_HOME  User-specific configuration files  ~/.var/app/<app-id>/config
XDG_DATA_HOME    User-specific data                 ~/.var/app/<app-id>/data
XDG_CACHE_HOME   Non-essential user-specific data   ~/.var/app/<app-id>/cache
XDG_STATE_HOME   State data such as undo history    ~/.var/app/<app-id>/.local/state
===============  =================================  ================================

For example, GNOME Dictionary will store user-specific data in::

  ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Dictionary/data/gnome-dictionary

Note that applications can be configured to use non-default base directory
locations (see :doc:`sandbox-permissions`).

Note that ``$XDG_STATE_HOME`` is only supported by Flatpak 1.13 and later. If
your app needs to work on earlier versions of Flatpak, you can use the
``--persist=.local/state`` and ``--unset-env=XDG_STATE_HOME`` finish args so
the app will use the correct directory, even after Flatpak is later upgraded to
>1.13.
