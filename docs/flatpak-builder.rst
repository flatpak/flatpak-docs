Flatpak Builder
===============

``flatpak-builder`` has already been introduced in :doc:`first-build`
and :doc:`building-introduction`. It is packaged by most of the popular
distributions and there is also a flatpak-builder `Flatpak package <https://flathub.org/apps/org.flatpak.Builder>`_
on Flathub.

This page provides additional details on how to use ``flatpak-builder``,
including the various command options that are available.

Exporting
---------

``flatpak-builder`` provides two options for exporting an application in
order to run it. The first is to export to a repository, from which the
application can be run. The second is to automatically install locally.

Exporting to a repository
`````````````````````````

The ``--repo`` option allows a repository to be specified, for the application
to be exported to. This takes the format::

 $ flatpak-builder --repo=<repo> <build-dir> <manifest>

Here, ``<repo>`` is a path to a repository. If no repository exists at the
specified location, the repository will be created. If the application is
already in the specified repository, ``flatpak-builder`` will add the build
as a new version of the existing application.

You can put more than one application in the same repository by using the same
``--repo`` path for multiple invocations of ``flatpak-builder``.

.. note::

  By default, ``flatpak-builder`` splits off translations and debug information
  into separate `.Locale` and `.Debug` extensions. These extensions are
  automatically exported into a repository along with the application.


Installing builds directly
``````````````````````````

Instead of exporting to a repository, the Flatpak that is produced by
``flatpak-builder`` can be automatically installed locally, using the
``--install`` option::

  $ flatpak-builder --install <build-dir> <manifest>

This approach has the advantage of skipping the separate install step that
is needed when exporting to a repository.

Signing
-------

Every commit to a Flatpak repository should be signed with a GPG signature. If
``flatpak-builder`` is being used to modify or create a repository, a GPG key
should therefore be passed to it. This can be done with the ``--gpg-sign``
option, such as::

  $ flatpak-builder --gpg-sign=<key> --repo=<repository> <manifest>

Here, ``<key>`` is the ID of the GPG key that is to be used. The
``--gpg-homedir`` option can also be used to specify the home directory of
the key that is being used.

Though it generally isn't recommended, it is possible not to use GPG
verification. In this case, the ``--no-gpg-verify`` option should be used
when adding the repository. Note that it is necessary to become root in
order to update a repository that does not have GPG verification enabled.
