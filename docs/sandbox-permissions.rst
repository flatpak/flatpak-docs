Sandbox Permissions
===================

One of Flatpak's main goals is to increase the security of desktop systems by
isolating applications from one another. This is achieved using sandboxing
and means that, by default, applications that are run with Flatpak have
extremely limited access to the host environment. This includes:

- No access to any host files except the runtime, the app,
  ``~/.var/app/$FLATPAK_ID``, and ``$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/app/$FLATPAK_ID``.
  Only the latter two being writable.
- No access to the network.
- No access to any device nodes (apart from ``/dev/null``, etc).
- No access to processes outside the sandbox.
- Limited syscalls.  For instance, apps can't use nonstandard network socket
  types or ptrace other processes.
- Limited access to the session D-Bus instance - an app can only own its
  own name on the bus.
- No access to host services like X11, system D-Bus, or PulseAudio.

Most applications will need access to some of these resources in order to
be useful. This is primarily done during the finishing build stage, which
can be configured through the ``finish-args`` section of the manifest file
(see :doc:`manifests`).

Portals
-------

Portals have already been mentioned in the :doc:`introduction`. They are a
framework for providing access to resources outside of the sandbox, including:

- Opening files with a native file chooser dialog
- Opening URIs
- Printing
- Showing notifications
- Taking screenshots
- Inhibiting the user session from ending, suspending, idling or getting
  switched away
- Getting network status information

In many cases, portals use a system component to implicitly ask the user
for permission before granting access to a particular resource. For example,
in the case of opening a file, the user's selection of a file using the file
chooser dialog is interpreted as implicitly granting the application access
to whatever file is chosen.

This approach enables applications to avoid having to configure blanket
access to large amounts of data or services and gives users control over
what their applications have access to.

Interface toolkits like GTK3 and Qt5 implement transparent support for
portals, meaning that applications don't need to do any additional
work to use them (it is worth checking which portals each toolkit
supports). Applications that aren't using a toolkit with support
for portals can refer to the `xdg-desktop-portal API documentation
<https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/portal-docs.html>`_ for
information on how to use them.

Permissions guidelines
----------------------

While application developers have control over the sandbox permissions they
wish to configure, good practice is encouraged and can be enforced. For
example, the Flathub hosting service places requirements on which permissions
can be used, and software on the host may warn users if certain permissions
are used.

The following guidelines describe which permissions can be freely used,
which can be used on an as-needed basis, and which should be avoided.

Standard permissions
````````````````````

The following permissions provide access to basic resources that applications
commonly require, and can therefore be freely used:

- ``--share=network`` - access the network
- ``--socket=x11`` - show windows using X11
- ``--socket=fallback-x11`` - show windows using X11, if Wayland is not
  available, overrides ``x11`` socket permission
- ``--share=ipc`` - share IPC namespace with the host (necessary for X11)
- ``--socket=wayland`` - show windows with Wayland
- ``--device=dri`` - OpenGL rendering
- ``--socket=pulseaudio`` - play sound with PulseAudio

D-Bus access
````````````

Access to the entire bus with ``--socket=system-bus`` or
``--socket=session-bus`` should be avoided, unless the application is a
development tool.

**Ownership**

Applications are automatically granted access to their own namespace. Ownership
beyond this is typically unnecessary, although there are a small
number of exceptions, such as using `MPRIS to provide media controls
<https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/>`_.

**Talk**

Talk permissions can be freely used, although it is recommended to use the
minimum required.

Filesystem access
`````````````````

It is common for applications to require access to different parts of the
host filesystem, and
Flatpak provides a flexible set of options for this. Some examples include:

- ``--filesystem=host`` - access normal files on the host, not including
  host os or system internals described below
- ``--filesystem=home`` - access the user's home directory
- ``--filesystem=/path/path`` - access specific paths
- ``--filesystem=xdg-download`` - access a specific XDG folder

As a general rule, Filesystem access should be limited as much as
possible. This includes:

- Using portals as an alternative to blanket filesystem access, wherever
  possible.
- Using read-only access wherever possible, using the ``:ro`` option.
- If some home directory access is absolutely required, using XDG directory
  access only.

The full list of available filesystem options can be found in the
:doc:`sandbox-permissions-reference`.
Other filesystem access guidelines include:

- The ``--persist=path`` option can be used to map paths from the user's
  home directory into the sandbox filesystem.
  This makes it possible to avoid configuring access to the entire home
  directory, and can be useful for applications that hardcode file paths in
  ``~/``.
- If an application uses ``$TMPDIR`` to contain lock files you may want to
  add a wrapper script that sets it to ``$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/app/$FLATPAK_ID``.
- Retaining and sharing configuration with non-Flatpak installations is to
  be avoided.

As mentioned above the ``host`` option does not actually provide complete
access to the
host filesystem. The main rules are:

- These directories are blacklisted: ``/lib``, ``/lib32``, ``/lib64``,
  ``/bin``, ``/sbin``, ``/usr``, ``/boot``, ``/root``,
  ``/tmp``, ``/etc``, ``/app``, ``/run``, ``/proc``, ``/sys``, ``/dev``,
  ``/var``
- Exceptions from the blacklist: ``/run/media``
- These directories are mounted under ``/var/run/host``: ``/etc``, ``/usr``

The reason many of the directories are blacklisted is because they already
exist in the sandbox such as ``/usr``
or are not usable in the sandbox.

Device access
`````````````

While not ideal, ``--device=all`` can be used to access devices like
controllers or webcams.

dconf access
````````````

As of xdg-desktop-portal 1.1.0 and glib 2.60.5 (in the runtime) you do not
need direct DConf access in most cases.

As of now this glib version is included in ``org.freedesktop.Platform//19.08``
and ``org.gnome.Platform//3.34``.

If an application existed prior to these runtimes you can tell Flatpak (>=
1.3.4) to migrate the DConf settings on the
host into the sandbox by adding
``--metadata=X-DConf=migrate-path=/org/example/foo/`` to ``finish-args``. The
path must be similar to your app-id or it will not be allowed (case is
ignored and ``_`` and ``-`` are treated equal).

If you are targeting older runtimes or require direct DConf access for other
reasons you can use these permissions::

  --filesystem=xdg-run/dconf
  --filesystem=~/.config/dconf:ro
  --talk-name=ca.desrt.dconf
  --env=DCONF_USER_CONFIG_DIR=.config/dconf

With those permissions glib will continue using dconf directly.
