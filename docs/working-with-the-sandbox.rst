Working with the Sandbox
========================

One of Flatpak's main goals is to increase the security of desktop systems by isolating applications from one another. This is done using sandboxing and it means that, by default, a Flatpak has extremely limited access to the host environment. This includes:

* No access to any host files except the runtime, the app and ``~/.var/app/$APPID``. Only the last of these is writable.
* No access to the network.
* No access to any device nodes (apart from ``/dev/null``, etc).
* No access to processes outside the sandbox.
* Limited syscalls.  For instance, apps can't use nonstandard network socket types or ptrace other processes.
* Limited access to the session D-Bus instance - an app can only own its own name on the bus.
* No access to host services like X, system D-Bus, or PulseAudio.

Most applications will need access to some of these resources in order to be useful, and Flatpak provides a number of ways to give an application access to them.

While there are no restrictions on which sandbox permissions an application can use, as good practice, it is recommended to use the minimum number of as permissions possible. Certain permissions, such as blanket access to the system bus (using the ``--socket=system-bus`` option) are strongly discouraged.

Configuring sandbox permissions
-------------------------------

Using the ``build-finish`` command is the simplest way to configure sandbox permissions. As was seen in a previous example, this can be used to add access to graphics sockets and the network::

  $ flatpak build-finish dictionary2 --socket=x11 --share=network --command=gnome-dictionary

These arguments translate into several properties in the application's metadata file::

  [Application]
  name=org.gnome.Dictionary
  runtime=org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/3.22
  sdk=org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/3.22
  command=gnome-dictionary

  [Context]
  shared=network;
  sockets=x11;
  
build-finish allows a whole range of resources to be added to an application. These options can also be passed to flatpak-builder as ``finish-args`` properties.

The table at the bottom of this page provides an overview of many sandbox permissions. The full list can also be viewed using ``flatpak build-finish --help``. 

.. note::
  Until a sandbox-compatible backend is available, access to dconf needs to be enabled using the following options::

    --filesystem=xdg-run/dconf
    --filesystem=~/.config/dconf:ro
    --talk-name=ca.desrt.dconf
    --env=DCONF_USER_CONFIG_DIR=.config/dconf

Portals
-------

Portals are a mechanism through which applications can interact with the host environment from within a sandbox. In this way, they give additional abilities to interact with data, files and services without the need to add sandbox permissions.

Interface toolkits can implement transparent support for portals. If an application uses one of these toolkits, there is no additional work required to access them.

Examples of capabilities that can be accessed through portals include:

* Inhibit the user session from ending, suspending, idling or getting switched away
* Network status information
* Notifications
* Open a URI
* Open files with a native file chooser dialog
* Printing
* Screenshots

Applications that aren't using a toolkit with support for portals can refer to the `xdg-desktop-portal API documentation <http://flatpak.org/xdg-desktop-portal/portal-docs.html>`_ for information on how to access them.

Overriding sandbox permissions
------------------------------

When developing an application, it can sometimes be useful to override a Flatpak's sandbox configuration. There are several ways to do this. One is to override them using ``flatpak run``, which accepts the same parameters as ``build-finish``. For example, this will let the Dictionary application see your home directory::

  $ flatpak run --filesystem=home --command=ls org.gnome.Dictionary ~/
  
``flatpak override`` can also be used to permanently override an application's permissions::

  $ flatpak --user override --filesystem=home org.gnome.Dictionary
  $ flatpak run --command=ls org.gnome.Dictionary ~/
  
It is also possible to remove permissions using the same method. You can use the following command to see what happens when access to the filesystem is removed, for example::

  $ flatpak run --nofilesystem=home --command=ls org.gnome.Dictionary ~/

Useful sandbox permissions
--------------------------

Flatpak provides an array of options for controlling sandbox permissions. The following are some of the most useful:

===================================================  ===========================================
``--filesystem=host``                                Access all files
``--filesystem=home``                                Access the home directory
``--filesystem=home:ro``                             Access the home directory, read-only
``--filesystem=/some/dir --filesystem=~/other/dir``  Access paths
``--filesystem=xdg-download``                        Access the XDG download directory
``--nofilesystem=...``                               Undo some of the above
``--socket=x11 --share=ipc``                         Show windows using X11 [#f1]_
``--device=dri``                                     OpenGL rendering
``--socket=wayland``                                 Show windows using Wayland
``--socket=pulseaudio``                              Play sounds using PulseAudio
``--share=network``                                  Access the network [#f2]_
``--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets``              Talk to a named service on the session bus
``--system-talk-name=org.freedesktop.GeoClue2``      Talk to a named service on the system bus
``--socket=system-bus``                              Unlimited access to all of D-Bus
===================================================  ===========================================

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] ``--share=ipc`` means that the sandbox shares IPC namespace with the host. This is not necessarily required, but without it the X shared memory extension will not work, which is very bad for X performance.
.. [#f2] Giving network access also grants access to all host services listening on abstract Unix sockets (due to how network namespaces work), and these have no permission checks. This unfortunately affects e.g. the X server and the session bus which listens to abstract sockets by default. A secure distribution should disable these and just use regular sockets.
